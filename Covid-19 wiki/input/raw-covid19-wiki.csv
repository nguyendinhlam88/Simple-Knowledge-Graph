Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019.[7] The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.[8]
Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever,[9] cough, headache,[10] fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.[11][12][13] Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.[14] Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[15] Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.[16] Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.[16]
Transmission of COVID-19 occurs when people are exposed to virus-containing respiratory droplets and airborne particles exhaled by an infected person.[17][18] Those particles may be inhaled or may reach the mouth, nose, or eyes of a person through touching or direct deposition (i.e. being coughed on).[17] The risk of infection is highest when people are in close proximity for a long time, but particles can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors in poorly ventilated and crowded spaces.[17][19] In those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.[17] Touching a contaminated surface or object may lead to infection although this does not contribute substantially to transmission.[17][20] People who are infected can transmit the virus to another person up to two days before they themselves show symptoms, as can people who do not experience symptoms.[21][22] People remain infectious for up to ten days after the onset of symptoms in moderate cases and up to twenty days in severe cases.[23]
Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab.
Preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimize the risk of transmissions.
While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus (and several vaccines for it have been approved and distributed in various countries, which have since initiated mass vaccination campaigns), the primary treatment is symptomatic. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as ""coronavirus"" and ""Wuhan coronavirus"",[24][25][26] with the disease sometimes called ""Wuhan pneumonia"".[27][28] In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu,[29] Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika virus.[30] In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov[31] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[32] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma.[33][34][35] The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020.[36] Tedros Adhanom explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).[37] The WHO additionally uses ""the COVID-19 virus"" and ""the virus responsible for COVID-19"" in public communications.[36]
Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.[38][39] Common symptoms include headache,[40] loss of smell[41] and taste,[42] nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever,[43] diarrhea, and breathing difficulties.[44] People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.[44] In people without prior ear, nose, and throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19.[45]
Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) and 5% of patients suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[46] At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[47][48][49][50] These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can spread the disease.[50][51][52][53] Other infected people will develop symptoms later, called ""pre-symptomatic"", or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.[53]
As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. The median delay for COVID-19 is four to five days.[54] Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.[54][55]
COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus strain.[citation needed]
The disease is mainly transmitted via the respiratory route when people inhale droplets and particles that infected people release as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing.[57] Infected people are more likely to transmit COVID-19 the when they are physically close. However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.[57]
Infectivity begins as early as three days before symptoms appear, and people are most infectious just prior to and during the onset of symptoms.[58] It declines after the first week, but infected people remain contagious for up to 20 days. People can spread the disease even if they are asymptomatic.[59][60][58]
Infectious particles range in size from aerosols that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time to larger droplets that remain airborne or fall to the ground.[57][61] Various groups utilize terms such as ""airborne"" and ""droplet"" both in technical and general ways, leading to confusion around terminology.[62] Additionally, COVID-19 research has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses transmit.[61][63] The largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far, and can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or mouth to infect.[57] Aerosols are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity, which leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close,[57][61][63] but airborne transmission can occur at longer distances, mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated;[57] in those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.[57]
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[68] All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature.[69]
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.[70]
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[71] It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).[72][73] The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV. The structure of the M protein resembles the sugar transporter SemiSWEET.[74]
The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages.[75][76] No standard nomenclature exists.[77] Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).[78] The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage.[76][79]
Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2020.[citation needed] Cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark.[citation needed] After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, it is believed to have been eradicated.[medical citation needed]
As of January 2021, three newer variants of SARS-CoV-2 are spreading among global populations, including the UK Variant (referred to as B.1.1.7) first found in London and Kent, a variant discovered in South Africa (referred to as B.1.351), and a variant discovered in Brazil (referred to as P.1).[80]
Using whole genome sequencing, epidemiology and modelling suggest the UK variant VUI-202012/01 (the first variant under investigation in December 2020) in the B.1.1.7 lineage transmits more easily than other strains.[81]
COVID-19 can affect the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).[82] The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs.[83] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a ""spike"" (peplomer) to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell.[84]
Whether SARS-CoV-2 is able to invade the nervous system remains unknown however it is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 people with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID-19, but these results need to be confirmed.[85] Loss of smell results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons.[86] SARS-CoV-2 could cause respiratory failure through affecting the brain stem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the CNS. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[87][88][89] The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell.[85]
The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium[90] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[91]
The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.[92] An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China,[93] and is more frequent in severe disease.[94] Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.[92] ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.[92][95] A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism have been found people transferred to Intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis.[96] Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots) are thought to play a significant role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia.[97] Furthermore, microvascular blood vessel damage has been reported in a small number of tissue samples of the brains – without detected SARS-CoV-2 – and the olfactory bulbs from those who have died from COVID-19.[98][99][100]
Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.[97] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.[101]
Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.[102]
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL‑2, IL‑7, IL‑6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM‑CSF), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP‑10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1‑alpha (MIP‑1‑alpha), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF‑α) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology.[93]
Additionally, people with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin.[103]
Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID-19.[104] Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.[102]
Multiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors. It includes two subunits: S1 and S2. S1 determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain. S2 mediates the membrane fusion of the virus to its potential cell host via the H1 and HR2, which are heptad repeat regions. Studies have shown that S1 domain induced IgG and IgA antibody levels at a much higher capacity. It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID-19 vaccines.[105]
The M protein is the viral protein responsible for the transmembrane transport of nutrients. It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope.[106] The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host's immune response.[106]
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-COV2 virus targets causing COVID-19. Theoretically the usage of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and ACE inhibitors upregulating ACE2 expression might increase morbidity with COVID-19, though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB. However no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes. Until further data is available, guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain.[107]
The effect of the virus on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability, alveolar wall permeability, as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants. These effects cause the majority of the respiratory symptoms. However, the aggravation of local inflammation causes a cytokine storm eventually leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome.[108]
Among healthy adults not exposed to SARS-CoV-2, about 35% have CD4+ T cells that recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (particularly the S2 subunit) and about 50% react to other proteins of the virus, suggesting cross-reactivity from previous common colds caused by other coronaviruses.[109]
The severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm.[110] Levels of interleukin 1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were all associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 disease.[111]
A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID-19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. The storm causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood clotting events such as strokes, myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and vasculitis. The production of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and interferon-gamma, all crucial components of normal immune responses, inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm. The cells of the central nervous system, the microglia, neurons, and astrocytes, are also involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward the CNS are not uncommon.[112]
Pregnancy response
Nowadays, there are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that they are prone to suffering from complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures.[113]
Physiological responses to pregnancy can include:
However, from the evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus.[113]
In addition to the above, other clinical studies have proved that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the period of pregnancy in different ways. On the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up to 12 weeks gestation. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavorable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy. Some examples of these could be fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, which refers to the fetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of life.[113]
COVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions.[114][115] Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection.[116] Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection.[114]
The standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests,[114][117] which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.[118] As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its ""ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.""[119] The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.[120][121] Results are generally available within hours.[114] The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.[122]
Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.[123]
The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence[124][125] that ""a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with"" and have called for ""an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing""[126] On 7 September, the UK government issued ""guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results"".[127]
Chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening.[116][128] Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.[116][129] Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.[116][130] Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.[131]
Many groups have created COVID-19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.[132] Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.[131] A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive.[115]
In late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.[133]
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations,[139] washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[140][141]
Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.[142][143]
The first COVID-19 vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2 December by the UK medicines regulator MHRA.[144] It was evaluated for emergency use authorization (EUA) status by the US FDA, and in several other countries.[145] Initially, the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID-19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial.[146][147] Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as ""flattening the curve"".[148] This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available.[148][149]
A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely celebrated for their role in reducing the spread, severity, and death caused by COVID-19.[citation needed] Prior to the COVID‑19 pandemic, an established body of knowledge existed about the structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). This knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine technologies during early 2020.[150] On 10 January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID, and by 19 March, the global pharmaceutical industry announced a major commitment to address COVID-19.[151]
In Phase III trials, several COVID‑19 vaccines have demonstrated efficacy as high as 95% in preventing symptomatic COVID‑19 infections. As of June 2021, 18 vaccines are authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use: two RNA vaccines (Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna), nine conventional inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, CoronaVac, Covaxin, CoviVac, COVIran Barakat, Minhai-Kangtai, QazVac, and WIBP-CorV), five viral vector vaccines (Sputnik Light, Sputnik V, Oxford–AstraZeneca, Convidecia, and Johnson & Johnson), and two protein subunit vaccines (EpiVacCorona and RBD-Dimer).[152][failed verification] In total, as of March 2021, 308 vaccine candidates are in various stages of development, with 73 in clinical research, including 24 in Phase I trials, 33 in Phase I–II trials, and 16 in Phase III development.[152]
Many countries have implemented phased distribution plans that prioritize those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.[153] Single dose interim use is under consideration to extend vaccination to as many people as possible until vaccine availability improves.[154][155][156]
The WHO and the US CDC recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.[162][163] This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.[163][164] Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.[163][164] A face covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air, reducing the chances of infection.[165] But, if the mask include an exhalation valve, a wearer that is infected (maybe without having noticed that, and asymptomatic) would transmit the virus outwards through it, despite any certification they can have. So the masks with exhalation valve are not for the infected wearers, and are not reliable to stop the pandemic in a large scale. Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.[166]
Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.[167] When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available. Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged. Healthcare professionals interacting directly with people who have COVID-19 are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent, in addition to other personal protective equipment.[168]
The CDC recommends that crowded indoor spaces should be avoided.[17] When indoors, increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission.[17][20] The WHO recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols.[169][170][171]
Exhaled respiratory particles can build-up within enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation. The risk of COVID-19 infection increases especially in spaces where people engage in physical exertion or raise their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing) as this increases exhalation of respiratory droplets. Prolonged exposure to these conditions, typically more than 15 minutes, leads to higher risk of infection.[17]
Thorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required.[172] The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose.[173] When soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol.[174] For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production. In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol. Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is ""not an active substance for hand antisepsis."" Glycerol is added as a humectant.[175]
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.[4] Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.[176]
Outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.[177][178] In the United States, the prisoner population is aging and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID-19 due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality healthcare.[177]
After being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days. If a person touches the dirty surface, they may deposit the virus at the eyes, nose, or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection.[179] Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID-19,[180][181][182] leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes.[183][184] Deep cleaning and other surface sanitation has been criticized as hygiene theater, giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air.[185][186]
The amount of time that the virus can survive depends significantly on the type of surface, the temperature, and the humidity.[187] Coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the UV light in sunlight.[187] Like other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2 survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower, and when the relative humidity is low (<50%).[187]
On many surfaces, including as glass, some types of plastic, stainless steel, and skin, the virus can remain infective for several days indoors at room temperature, or even about a week under ideal conditions.[187][188] On some surfaces, including cotton fabric and copper, the virus usually dies after a few hours.[187] The virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces due to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation.[189][182][187] However, of the many surfaces tested, two with the longest survival times are N95 respirator masks and surgical masks, both of which are considered porous surfaces.[187]
The CDC says that in most situations, cleaning surfaces with soap or detergent, not disinfecting, is enough to reduce risk of transmission.[190][191] The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected.[192] Surfaces may be decontaminated with 62–71 percent ethanol, 50–100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5 percent povidone-iodine. Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may also be used.[169] A datasheet comprising the authorised substances to disinfection in the food industry (including suspension or surface tested, kind of surface, use dilution, disinfectant and inocuylum volumes) can be seen in the supplementary material of.[183]
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.[193] Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups.[194] Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.[citation needed]
The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health recommends a healthy diet, being physically active, managing psychological stress, and getting enough sleep.[195]
Consistently meeting scientific guidelines of 150+ minutes per week of exercise or similar physical activity was shown to be associated with a smaller risk of hospitalisation and death due to COVID-19, even when considering likely risk factors such as elevated BMI.[196][197]
As of March 2021, there is no evidence that vitamin D status has any relationship with COVID-19 health outcomes.[198] The largest clinical trial on the subject, with over 6 000 participants and a dosage regime near the RDI, is set to conclude in July 2021.[199][200]
A 2021 Cochrane rapid review found that based upon low-certainty evidence, international travel-related control measures such as restricting cross-border travel may help to contain the spread of COVID-19.[201] Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases.[201] While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up. The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening.[201]

There is no specific, effective treatment or cure for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.[202][needs update][203] Thus, the cornerstone of management of COVID-19 is supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support and prone positioning as needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.[204][205][206]
Most cases of COVID-19 are mild. In these, supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDs to relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids, rest, and nasal breathing.[207][203][208][209] Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended.[210] The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask.[211]
People with more severe cases may need treatment in hospital. In those with low oxygen levels, use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone is strongly recommended, as it can reduce the risk of death.[212][213][214] Noninvasive ventilation and, ultimately, admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing.[215] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.[216][217]
The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalization.[222] Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.[72] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised. However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death.[223] Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to ICU.[224][225]
Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.[226][227] A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.[228] On 30 October 2020 WHO chief Tedros Adhanom warned that ""to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects."" He has described the vast spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as ""really concerning"". They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs – including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. Tedros has concluded that therefore herd immunity is ""morally unconscionable and unfeasible"".[229]
In terms of hospital readmissions about 9% of 106,000 individuals had to return for hospital treatment within two months of discharge. The average to readmit was eight days since first hospital visit. There are several risk factors that have been identified as being a cause of multiple admissions to a hospital facility. Among these are advanced age (above 65 years of age) and presence of a chronic condition such as diabetes, COPD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease.[230][231]
According to scientific reviews smokers are more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers,[232][233] air pollution is similarly associated with risk factors,[233] and pre-existing heart and lung diseases[234] and also obesity contributes to an increased health risk of COVID-19.[233][235][236]
It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2.[237] One research that looked into the COVID-19 infections in hospitalized kidney transplant recipients found a mortality rate of 11%.[238]
Genetics also plays an important role in the ability to fight off the disease.[239] For instance, those that do not produce detectable type I interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from COVID-19.[240][241] Genetic screening is able to detect interferon effector genes.[242]
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from other similar viruses, like SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is lacking.
While very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole.[243][244] Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults. The CDC reports that in the US roughly a third of hospitalized children were admitted to the ICU,[245] while a European multinational study of hospitalized children from June 2020 found that about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care.[246] Four of the 582 children (0.7%) in the European study died, but the actual mortality rate could be ""substantially lower"" since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study.[247][248]
Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death.[249][250][251][252] Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation), heart inflammation, and thrombosis, particularly venous thromboembolism.[253][254][255][256][257][258] Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury.[259][147]
Neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (which includes loss of motor functions).[260][261] Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.[262][263] In very rare cases, acute encephalopathy can occur, and it can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have an altered mental status.[264]
In the case of pregnant women, it is important to note that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19.[265] This is because pregnant women with COVID-19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction.[265]
Other rare complications include mucormycosis.[266]
Some early studies suggest that ten to twenty percent of people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.[267][227] A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems, including fatigue and shortness of breath.[268] About 5-10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.[269]
By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID-19.[270] The majority of CT scans performed show lung abnormalities in people tested after 28 days of illness.[271]
People with advanced age, severe disease, prolonged ICU stays, or who smoke are more likely to have long-lasting effects, including pulmonary fibrosis.[272] Overall, approximately one-third of those investigated after four weeks will have findings of pulmonary fibrosis or reduced lung function as measured by DLCO, even in asymptomatic people, but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time.[270]
The immune response by humans to CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production,[273] just as with most other infections.[274] Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease.[275] The presence of neutralizing antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the level of neutralizing antibody declines with time. Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody two months after infection. In another study, the level of neutralizing antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms. However, the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-2. Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms.[275]
Nevertheless, 15 cases of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported using stringent CDC criteria requiring identification of a different variant from the second infection. There are likely to be many more people who have been reinfected with the virus. Herd immunity will not eliminate the virus if reinfection is common.[275] Some other coronaviruses circulating in people are capable of reinfection after roughly a year.[276] Nonetheless, on 3 March 2021, scientists reported that a much more contagious COVID-19 variant, Lineage P.1, first detected in Japan, and subsequently found in Brazil, as well as in several places in the United States, may be associated with COVID-19 disease reinfection after recovery from an earlier COVID-19 infection.[277][278]
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.[279] These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.[280]
The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths within a specific demographic group divided by the population of that demographic group. Consequently, the mortality rate reflects the prevalence as well as the severity of the disease within a given population. Mortality rates are highly correlated to age, with relatively low rates for young people and relatively high rates among the elderly.[281][282][283] In fact, one relevant factor of mortality rates is the age structure of the countries’ populations. For example, the case fatality rate for COVID-19 is lower in India than in the US since India's younger population represents a larger percentage than in the US.[284]
The case fatality rate (CFR) reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.2% (3,862,120/178,315,490) as of 20 June 2021.[6] The number varies by region.[285][286] The CFR may not reflect the true severity of the disease, because some infected individuals remain asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms, and hence such infections may not be included in official case reports. Moreover, the CFR may vary markedly over time and across locations due to the availability of live virus tests.
Total confirmed cases over time
Total confirmed cases of COVID-19 per million people[287]
Total deaths over time
Total confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 per million people[288]
A key metric in gauging the severity of COVID-19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk.[289][290][291] This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to the CFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases.[292]
A December 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population IFR during the first wave of the pandemic was about 0.5% to 1% in many locations (including France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in other locations (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and exceeded 2% in Italy.[293] That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85.[293] These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the WHO.[294]
An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom a fatal COVID-19 infection is two orders of magnitude more likely than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza.[293]
At an early stage of the pandemic, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.3% and 1%.[295][296] On 2 July, The WHO's chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%.[297][298] In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%.[299] Firm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate. As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4 million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with COVID-19 (0.3% of the population).[300] Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ~0.9%,[301] and ~1.4%.[302] In Bergamo province, 0.6% of the population has died.[303] In September 2020 the U.S. Center for Disease Control & Prevention reported preliminary estimates of age-specific IFRs for public health planning purposes.[304]
COVID-19 case fatality rates are higher among men than women in most countries. However, in a few countries like India, Nepal, Vietnam, and Slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women than men.[284] Globally, men are more likely to be admitted to the ICU and more likely to die.[306][307] One meta-analysis found that globally, men were more likely to get COVID-19 than women; there were approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections (CI: 51.43–56.58).[308]
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.[309] Later reviews in June 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between genders.[310][311] One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.[312] Smoking, which in some countries like China is mainly a male activity, is a habit that contributes to increasing significantly the case fatality rates among men.[284] Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.[313] In Europe, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of those died with COVID-19 were men.[314] As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID-19 infections.[315] Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.[315]
In the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups.[316] Structural factors that prevent them from practicing social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in ""essential"" occupations such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, health-care workers and custodial staff. Greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care of underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease also increase their risk of death.[317] Similar issues affect Native American and Latino communities.[316] On the one hand, in the Dominican Republic there is a clear example of both gender and ethnic inequality. In this Latin American territory, there is great inequality and precariousness that especially affects Dominican women, with greater emphasis on those of Haitian descent.[318] According to a US health policy non-profit, 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults.[319] The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water.[320] Leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities.[321] In the U.K., a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred in those of a Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority background.[322][323][324] More severe impacts upon victims including the relative incidence of the necessity of hospitalization requirements, and vulnerability to the disease has been associated via DNA analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region 3, features that are associated with European Neanderthal heritage. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease.[325] The findings are from Professor Svante Pääbo and researchers he leads at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the Karolinska Institutet.[325] This admixture of modern human and Neanderthal genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago in Southern Europe.[325]
Biological factors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID-19.[284] Most of those who die of COVID-19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.[326] According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.[327] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases.[223] According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths), type 2 diabetes (29.8% of deaths), Ischemic Heart Disease (27.6% of deaths), atrial fibrillation (23.1% of deaths) and chronic renal failure (20.2% of deaths).
Most critical respiratory comorbidities according to the CDC, are: moderate or severe asthma, pre-existing COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis.[328] Evidence stemming from meta-analysis of several smaller research papers also suggests that smoking can be associated with worse outcomes.[329][330] When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID-19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms.[331] COVID-19 also poses a greater risk to people who misuse opioids and methamphetamines, insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage.[332]
In August 2020 the CDC issued a caution that tuberculosis (TB) infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death. The WHO recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID-19 could not rule out co-infections. Some projections have estimated that reduced TB detection due to the pandemic could result in 6.3 million additional TB cases and 1.4 million TB-related deaths by 2025.[333]
The virus is thought to be natural and of an animal origin,[69] through spillover infection.[334] There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) originated and investigations into the origin of the pandemic are ongoing.[335] Phylogenetics estimates that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019.[336][337][338] A phylogenetic algorithm analysis suggested that the virus may have been circulating in Guangdong before Wuhan.[339] Although one Italian study suggests it was present there as early as September 2019.[340] Evidence suggests that it descends from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host.[341][342] The possibility that the virus was accidentally released from a laboratory is also under increasingly active consideration.[343]
The first confirmed human infections were in Wuhan, Hubei, China. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.[344][345][346] Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019.[347] Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020.[348][349] According to official Chinese sources, these were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.[350] In May 2020 George Gao, the director of the CDC, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an early superspreading event, but that it was not the site of the initial outbreak.[351] Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected in Milan and Turin, Italy, on 18 December 2019.[352]
By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.[353][354] The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December,[355] and at least 266 by 31 December.[356] On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.[357] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[358] On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on ""the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause"" that same evening.[359] Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang (punished on 3 January),[360] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[361]
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 December, confirming 27 cases[362][363][364] – enough to trigger an investigation.[365]
During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[366] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.[72] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.[367] Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then,[368] and more may have been infected.[369] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its ""pandemic potential"".[93][370] On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.[369] By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times.[371]
Italy had its first confirmed cases on 31 January 2020, two tourists from China.[372] Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths on 19 March 2020 .[373] By 26 March the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.[374] Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.[375] Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019,[376][377] and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.[378]
RT-PCR testing of untreated wastewater samples from Brazil and Italy have suggested detection of SARS-CoV-2 as early as November and December 2019, respectively, but the methods of such sewage studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a risk of false positives due to contamination or if only one gene target is detected.[379] A September 2020 review journal article said, ""The possibility that the COVID-19 infection had already spread to Europe at the end of last year is now indicated by abundant, even if partially circumstantial, evidence,"" including pneumonia case numbers and radiology in France and Italy in November and December.[380]
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online.[381][382][383]
In September 2020, the U.S. CDC published preliminary estimates of the risk of death by age groups in the United States, but those estimates were widely misreported and misunderstood.[384][385]
Humans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis.
Some pets, especially cats and ferrets, can catch this virus from infected humans.[386][387] Symptoms in cats include respiratory (such as a cough) and digestive symptoms.[386] Cats can spread the virus to other cats, and may be able to spread the virus to humans, but cat-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been proven.[386][388] Compared to cats, dogs are less susceptible to this infection.[388] Behaviors which increase the risk of transmission include kissing, licking, and petting the animal.[388]
The virus does not appear to be able to infect pigs, ducks, or chickens at all.[386] Mice, rats, and rabbits, if they can be infected at all, are unlikely to be involved in spreading the virus.[388]
Tigers and lions in zoos have become infected as a result of contact with infected humans.[388] As expected, monkeys and great ape species such as orangutans can also be infected with the COVID-19 virus.[388]
Minks, which are in the same family as ferrets, have been infected.[388] Minks may be asymptomatic, and can also spread the virus to humans.[388] Multiple countries have identified infected animals in mink farms.[389] Denmark, a major producer of mink pelts, ordered the slaughter of all minks over fears of viral mutations.[389] A vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched.[389]
International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID-19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers.[390][391] The CDC has classified it to require a BSL3 grade laboratory.[392] There has been a great deal of COVID-19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand.[393]
As of December 2020, hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every continent except Antarctica.[394] As of November 2020, more than 200 possible treatments had been studied in humans so far.[395]
Modelling research has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission,[396] diagnosis and prognosis of infection,[397] estimation of the impact of interventions,[398][399] or allocation of resources.[400] Modelling studies are mostly based on epidemiological models,[401] estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions. Several other types of models have been developed and used during the COVID-19 including computational fluid dynamics models to study the flow physics of COVID-19,[402] retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure,[403] mobility-data based models to investigate transmission,[404] or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the economic impact of the pandemic.[405] Further, conceptual frameworks from crisis management research have been applied to better understand the effects of COVID-19 on organizations worldwide.[406][407]
Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID-19 treatments.[408][409] Other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.[409]
In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated the Solidarity trial to assess the treatment effects of some promising drugs: an experimental drug called remdesivir; anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; two anti-HIV drugs, lopinavir/ritonavir; and interferon-beta.[410][411] More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.[147]
Research on the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine showed that they were ineffective at best,[412][413] and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir.[414] By May 2020, France, Italy, and Belgium had banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment.[415]
In June, initial results from the randomised RECOVERY Trial in the United Kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for people who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen.[416] Because this is a well-tested and widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the WHO, which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids.[417][418] Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen.[419]
In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID-19.[420] The WHO recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical COVID-19 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence).[420] The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non-severe COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence).[420] The updated guidance was based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill COVID-19 patients.[421][422]
In September 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents from twelve years of age and weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb) who require supplemental oxygen therapy.[423][424] Dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a vein.[423]
In November 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19.[425] Bamlanivimab is authorized for people with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are twelve years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb), and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 or hospitalization.[425] This includes those who are 65 years of age or older, or who have chronic medical conditions.[425]
In February 2021, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID‑19 in people twelve years of age or older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb) who test positive for SARS‑CoV‑2 and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID‑19. The authorized use includes treatment for those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions.[426]
In April 2021, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) that allowed for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and certain pediatric patients.[427]
A cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19. A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released too quickly; A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure.[428] Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID-19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses; These high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm.[429]
Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed.[430][431] It is undergoing a Phase II non-randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.[432][433] Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.[434] The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA to undergo a Phase III clinical trial assessing its effectiveness on COVID-19 based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.[435] To date,[when?] there is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS. Prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum IL-6 levels by saturating the IL-6R, driving IL-6 across the blood-brain barrier, and exacerbating neurotoxicity while having no effect on the incidence of CRS.[436]
Lenzilumab, an anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, is protective in murine models for CAR T cell-induced CRS and neurotoxicity and is a viable therapeutic option due to the observed increase of pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T cells in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.[437]
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation.[438][439] Viral neutralization is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies.[440] As of 8 August 2020, eight neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies.[441] It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID-19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections.[440] Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis, may be possible.[438] Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.[438]
The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID-19 is also being studied. This involves the production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then administered to active patients.[438] This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.[438] An updated Cochrane review in May 2021 found high certainty evidence that for the treatment of people with moderate to severe COVID-19 convalescent plasma did not reduce mortality or bring about symptom improvement[439] There continues to be uncertainty about the safety of convalescent plasma administration to people with COVID-19 and differing outcomes measured in different studies limits their use in determining efficacy.[439]
There was a report[442] on 3 March 2021, that social distancing and common wearing of surgical masks and similar as a common precaution against COVID-19 caused such a drop in the spread rate of the common cold and flu that in Britain the sale of cough liquids and throat lozenges and decongestants from 30 November 2020 to 21 February 2021, was about a half of the sale a year earlier, and that Public Health England reported no cases of flu in the year 2021 to date, and that there was an 89% rise in sales of Vitamin D to try to boost immunity.

1,COVID-19 pandemic,"
The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 20 June 2021, more than 178 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3.86 million confirmed deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.
The severity of COVID-19 symptoms is highly variable, ranging from unnoticeable to life-threatening. Severe illness is more likely in elderly COVID-19 patients, as well as those who have underlying medical conditions. COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids, in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop any symptoms.[5][6]
Recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing face masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand washing, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic. Several vaccines have been developed and widely distributed in most developed countries since December 2020. Current treatments focus on addressing symptoms, but work is underway to develop medications that inhibit the virus. Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns and quarantines, workplace hazard controls, and business closures. Numerous jurisdictions have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected.[7]
The pandemic has resulted in significant global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.[8] It has led to widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, agricultural disruption, and food shortages. However, there have also been decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. Numerous educational institutions and public areas have been partially or fully closed, and many events have been cancelled or postponed. Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media, and political tensions have been exacerbated. The pandemic has raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination, health equity, and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights.
Although the exact origin of the virus is still unknown,[9] the first outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China in late 2019. Many early cases of COVID-19 were linked to people who had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan,[10][11][12] but it is possible that human-to-human transmission was already happening before this.[13][14] On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease ""COVID-19"", which is short for coronavirus disease 2019.[15][16] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[17] pangolin coronaviruses,[18][19] and SARS-CoV.[20] The current scientific consensus is that the virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, from bats or another closely-related mammal.[21][22][23][13] Despite this, the subject has generated a significant amount of speculation and conspiracy theories,[24][14] which were amplified by rapidly growing online echo chambers.[25] Global geopolitical divisions, notably between the United States and China, have been heightened because of this issue.[26][27][28]
The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.[29][30] However, an earlier case of infection could have occurred on 17 November.[31] Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.[32][33][34] Molecular clock analysis suggests that the index case is likely to have been infected with the virus between mid-October and mid-November 2019.[35][36]
Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.[37][38] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.[39][40] An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 per cent of documented cases.[41] Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.[42][43]
On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 per cent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.[44] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.[45][46] Seroprevalence based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.[47] Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.[48]
An analysis in early 2020 of cases by age in China indicated that a relatively low proportion of cases occurred in individuals under 20.[49] It was not clear whether this was because young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.[50] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.[51]
Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5,[52] but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 per cent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).[53] R0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity. By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.[54]

Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols. These counts may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.[56] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to over-counting.[57] Comparisons of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicate excess mortality in many countries.[58][59] This may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.[60] The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.[61] The first reported death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[62] and the first reported death outside Asia was in the United States on 6 February.[63]
More than 95 per cent of the people who contract COVID-19 recover. Otherwise, the time between symptoms onset and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.[64] As of 20 June 2021, more than 3.86 million[3] deaths have been attributed to COVID-19. People at the greatest risk of mortality from COVID-19 tend to be those with underlying conditions, such as those with a weakened immune system, serious heart or lung problems, severe obesity, or the elderly (including individuals age 65 years or older).[65][66]
Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.[67] These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response,[68][69][70] time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.[71] Countries like Belgium include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.[72]
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.2 percent (3,862,120 deaths for 178,315,490 cases) as of 20 June 2021.[3] The number varies by region.[73]

The official death counts have been criticised for underreporting the actual death toll, because comparisons of death rates before and during the pandemic show an increase in deaths that is not explained by COVID-19 deaths alone.[74] Using such data, estimates of the true number of deaths from COVID-19 worldwide have included a range from 7 to 13 million by The Economist, as well as over 9 million by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.[74][75]
On 24 March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, indicated the WHO had provided two codes for COVID-19: U07.1 when confirmed by laboratory testing and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiological diagnosis where laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available.[76][77] The CDC noted that ""Because laboratory test results are not typically reported on death certificates in the U.S., [the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)] is not planning to implement U07.2 for mortality statistics"" and that U07.1 would be used ""If the death certificate reports terms such as 'probable COVID-19' or 'likely COVID-19'."" The CDC also noted ""It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases"" and while the ""underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate, ... the rules for coding and selection of the ... cause of death are expected to result in COVID–19 being the underlying cause more often than not.""[76]
On 16 April 2020, the WHO, in its formal publication of the two codes, U07.1 and U07.2, ""recognized that in many countries detail as to the laboratory confirmation... will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality purposes only, to code COVID-19 provisionally to code U07.1 unless it is stated as 'probable' or 'suspected'.""[78][79] It was also noted that the WHO ""does not distinguish"" between infection by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.[80]
A crucial metric in assessing the severity of a disease is the infection fatality ratio (IFR), which is the cumulative number of deaths attributed to the disease divided by the cumulative number of infected individuals (including asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections) as measured or estimated as of a specific date.[81][82][83] Epidemiologists frequently refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality rate' to clarify that it is expressed in percentage points (not as a decimal).[84][85][86] Other published studies refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality risk'.[87][88]
In November 2020, a review article in Nature reported estimates of population-weighted IFRs for a number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly care facilities, and found a median range of 0.24% to 1.49%.[89]
In December 2020, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the European Journal of Epidemiology estimated that population-weighted IFR was 0.5% to 1% in some countries (France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in several other countries (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and about 2.5% in Italy; these estimates included fatalities in elderly care facilities.[90] This study also found that most of the differences in IFR across locations reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and the age-specific pattern of infection rates, due to very low IFRs for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) and progressively higher IFRs for older adults (0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85).[90] These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the World Health Organization.[91]
An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom a fatal COVID-19 infection is two orders of magnitude more likely than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza.[90]
Another metric in assessing death rate is the case fatality ratio (CFR),[a] which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals diagnosed to-date. This metric can be misleading because of the delay between symptom onset and death and because testing focuses on individuals with symptoms (and particularly on those manifesting more severe symptoms).[80] On 4 August 2020, WHO indicated ""at this early stage of the pandemic, most estimates of fatality ratios have been based on cases detected through surveillance and calculated using crude methods, giving rise to widely variable estimates of CFR by country – from less than 0.1% to over 25%.""[82]
Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.[92][93] Common symptoms include headache,[94] loss of smell[95] and taste,[96] nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever,[97] diarrhea, and breathing difficulties.[98] People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.[98] In people without prior ear, nose, and throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19.[99]
Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) and 5% of patients suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[100] At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[101][102][103][104] These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can spread the disease.[104][105][106][107] Other infected people will develop symptoms later, called ""pre-symptomatic"", or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.[107]
As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. The median delay for COVID-19 is four to five days.[108] Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.[108][109]
The disease is mainly transmitted via the respiratory route when people inhale droplets and particles that infected people release as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing.[111] Infected people are more likely to transmit COVID-19 the when they are physically close. However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.[111]
Infectivity begins as early as three days before symptoms appear, and people are most infectious just prior to and during the onset of symptoms.[112] It declines after the first week, but infected people remain contagious for up to 20 days. People can spread the disease even if they are asymptomatic.[113][114][112]
Infectious particles range in size from aerosols that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time to larger droplets that remain airborne or fall to the ground.[111][115] Various groups utilize terms such as ""airborne"" and ""droplet"" both in technical and general ways, leading to confusion around terminology.[116] Additionally, COVID-19 research has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses transmit.[115][117] The largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far, and can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or mouth to infect.[111] Aerosols are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity, which leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close,[111][115][117] but airborne transmission can occur at longer distances, mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated;[111] in those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.[111]
SARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses.[122] It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. Coronaviruses infect humans, other mammals, and avian species, including livestock and companion animals.[123] Human coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, fatality rate ~34%). SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV.[124]
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations,[144] washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[145][146]
In Phase III trials, several COVID‑19 vaccines have demonstrated efficacy as high as 95% in preventing symptomatic COVID‑19 infections. As of June 2021, 18 vaccines are authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use: two RNA vaccines (Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna), nine conventional inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, CoronaVac, Covaxin, CoviVac, COVIran Barakat, Minhai-Kangtai, QazVac, and WIBP-CorV), five viral vector vaccines (Sputnik Light, Sputnik V, Oxford–AstraZeneca, Convidecia, and Johnson & Johnson), and two protein subunit vaccines (EpiVacCorona and RBD-Dimer).[149][failed verification] In total, as of March 2021, 308 vaccine candidates are in various stages of development, with 73 in clinical research, including 24 in Phase I trials, 33 in Phase I–II trials, and 16 in Phase III development.[149]
On 21 December 2020, the European Union approved the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. Vaccinations began to be administered on 27 December 2020. The Moderna vaccine was authorised on 6 January 2021 and the AstraZeneca vaccine was authorised on 29 January 2021.[154]
On 4 February 2020, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar published a notice of declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID-19, covering ""any vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate COVID-19, or the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or a virus mutating therefrom"", and stating that the declaration precludes ""liability claims alleging negligence by a manufacturer in creating a vaccine, or negligence by a health care provider in prescribing the wrong dose, absent willful misconduct"".[155] The declaration is effective in the United States through 1 October 2024.[156] On 8 December it was reported that the AstraZeneca vaccine is about 70% effective, according to a study.[157]
By mid-June 2021, 85 percent of vaccinations have been administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Only 0.3 percent of doses have been administered in low-income countries.[158]
There is no specific, effective treatment or cure for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.[159][160] Thus, the cornerstone of management of COVID-19 is supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support and prone positioning as needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.[161][162][163]
Most cases of COVID-19 are mild. In these, supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDs to relieve symptoms (fever,[164] body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids, rest, and nasal breathing.[165][160][166][167] Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended.[168] The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask.[169]
People with more severe cases may need treatment in hospital. In those with low oxygen levels, use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone is strongly recommended, as it can reduce the risk of death.[170][171][172] Noninvasive ventilation and, ultimately, admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing.[173] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.[174][175]
Several experimental treatments are being actively studied in clinical trials.[159] Others were thought to be promising early in the pandemic, such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, but later research found them to be ineffective or even harmful.[159][176][177] Despite ongoing research, there is still not enough high-quality evidence to recommend so-called early treatment.[176][177] Nevertheless, in the United States, two monoclonal antibody-based therapies are available for early use in cases thought to be at high risk of progression to severe disease.[177] The antiviral remdesivir is available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and several other countries, with varying restrictions; however, it is not recommended for people needing mechanical ventilation, and is discouraged altogether by the World Health Organization (WHO),[178] due to limited evidence of its efficacy.[159]
Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged that are spreading globally. The most currently prevalent, all of which share the more infectious D614G mutation, are:[179][180]
Speed and scale are key to mitigation, due to the fat-tailed nature of pandemic risk and the exponential growth of COVID-19 infections.[187] For mitigation to be effective, (a) chains of transmission must be broken as quickly as possible through screening and containment, (b) health care must be available to provide for the needs of those infected, and (c) contingencies must be in place to allow for effective rollout of (a) and (b).
Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression), and mitigation. Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the infection.[191] Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading. When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.[192] Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.[193]
Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.[188] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.[188] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.[194] Some measures, particularly those that focus on cleaning surfaces rather than preventing airborne transmission, have been criticised as hygiene theatre.[195]
More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.[196] Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised the hoarding of medical supplies.[197]
Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges. Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems. Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.[193]
Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.[198] The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.[199]
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.[199] (Users are alerted if they have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.)[199]
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing based on Bluetooth technology and cryptography.[200][201] The system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps, with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android mobile platforms.[202] In Europe and in the U.S., Palantir Technologies is also providing COVID-19 tracking services.[203]
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.[204] The ECDC and the European regional office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.[204][205] In addition, in an attempt to maintain physical distancing, and to protect both patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually.[206][207][208]
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some manufacturers are 3D printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.[209][210] In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight.[211][212][213] On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing. NASA is seeking fast-track approval.[214][215] Individuals and groups of makers around the world also assisted in the efforts by creating and sharing open source designs, and manufacturing devices using locally sourced materials, sewing, and 3D printing. Millions of face shields, protective gowns, and masks were made. Other medical supplies were made such as shoes covers, surgical caps, powered air-purifying respirators, and hand sanitizer. Novel devices were created such as ear savers, non-invasive ventilation helmets, and ventilator splitters.[216]
Based on the retrospective analysis, starting from December 2019, the number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December and at least 266 by 31 December.[217]
On 24 December 2019, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals.[citation needed] On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.[218][219] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[220]
On 30 December 2019, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated that there was an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. Eight of those doctors, including Li Wenliang (who was also punished on 3 January),[221] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours; and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[222] That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions about ""the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause"".[223] The next day, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause, confirming 27 cases[224][225][226]—enough to trigger an investigation.[227]
The following day, on 31 December, the WHO office in China was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan.[228][224] An investigation was launched at the start of January 2020.[227]
According to official Chinese sources, the early cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.[229] However, in May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating the market was not the source of the initial outbreak.[230] In March 2021, the WHO published their report on the potential zoonotic source of the virus. The WHO concluded that human spillover via an intermediate animal host was the most likely explanation, with direct spillover from bats next most likely and introduction through the food supply chain as another possible explanation.[231][12]
From 31 December 2019 to 3 January 2020, a total of 44 cases of ""pneumonia of unknown causes"" were reported to WHO by the Chinese authorities.
On 11 January, WHO received further information from the Chinese National Health Commission that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan, and that the Chinese authorities had identified a new type of coronavirus, which was isolated on 7 January.[228]
During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[232] In early and mid-January, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.[233] On 10 January, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID.[234] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.[235] A retrospective official study published in March found that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January (most of them would be diagnosed later)[236] and more may have been infected.[237] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its ""pandemic potential"".[32][238] On 31 January The Lancet would publish the first modelling study explicitly warning of inevitable ""independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally"" and calling for ""large-scale public health interventions.""[239]
On 30 January, with 7,818 confirmed cases across 19 countries, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC),[240][241] and then a pandemic on 11 March 2020[242][243] as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported increasing numbers of cases.
On 31 January, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China.[244] On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the most reported deaths.[245] By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.[246] Research on SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.[247] Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019[248][249] and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.[250]
On 11 June, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case being officially reported,[251] the city of Beijing reported a single COVID-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 June.[252] As of 15 June 2020, 79 cases were officially confirmed.[253] Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market.[251][254]
On 29 June, WHO warned that the spread of the virus was still accelerating as countries reopened their economies, despite many countries having made progress in slowing down the spread.[255]
On 15 July, one COVID-19 case was officially reported in Dalian in more than three months. The patient did not travel outside the city in the 14 days before developing symptoms, nor did he have contact with people from ""areas of attention.""[256]
In October, the WHO stated, at a special meeting of WHO leaders, that one in ten people around the world may have been infected with COVID-19. At the time, that translated to 780 million people being infected, while only 35 million infections had been confirmed.[257]
In early November, Denmark reported on an outbreak of a unique mutated variant being transmitted to humans from minks in its North Jutland Region. All twelve human cases of the mutated variant were identified in September 2020. The WHO released a report saying the variant ""had a combination of mutations or changes that have not been previously observed.""[258] In response, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen ordered for the country – the world's largest producer of mink fur – to cull its mink population by as many as 17 million.[259]
On 9 November, Pfizer released their trial results for a candidate vaccine, showing that it is 90% effective against the virus.[260] Later that day, Novavax entered an FDA Fast Track application for their vaccine.[261] Virologist and U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci indicated that the Pfizer vaccine targets the spike protein used to infect cells by the virus. Some issues left to be answered are how long the vaccine offers protection, and if it offers the same level of protection to all ages. Initial doses will likely go to healthcare workers on the front lines.[262]
On 9 November 2020, the United States surpassed 10 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, making it the country with the most cases worldwide by a large margin.[263]
It was reported on 27 November, that a publication released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that the current numbers of viral infection are via confirmed laboratory test only. However, the true number could be about eight times the reported number; the report further indicated that the true number of virus infected cases could be around 100 million in the U.S.[264][265]
On 14 December, Public Health England reported a new variant had been discovered in the South East of England, predominantly in Kent. The variant, named Variant of Concern 202012/01, showed changes to the spike protein which could make the virus more infectious. As of 13 December, there were 1,108 cases identified.[266] Many countries halted all flights from the UK;[267] France-bound Eurotunnel service was suspended and ferries carrying passengers and accompanied freight were cancelled as the French border closed to people on 20 December.[268]
On 2 January, VOC-202012/01, a variant of SARS-CoV-2 first discovered in the UK, had been identified in 33 countries around the world, including Pakistan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Norway, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, India, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, and China.[269]
On 6 January, the P.1 variant was first identified in Japanese travellers who had just returned from Brazil.[270]
On 12 January, it was reported that a team of scientists from the World Health Organization would arrive in Wuhan on the 14th of the month; this is to ascertain the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and determine what were the intermediate hosts between the original reservoir and humans.[271] On the following day, two of the WHO members were barred from entering China because, according to the country, antibodies for the virus were detected in both.[272]
On 29 January, it was reported that the Novavax vaccine was only 49% effective against the 501.V2 variant in a clinical trial in South Africa.[273][274] The China COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac indicated 50.4% effectivity in a Brazil clinical trial.[275]
On 12 March, it was reported that several countries including Thailand, Denmark, Bulgaria, Norway, and Iceland had stopped using the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine due to what was being called severe blood clotting problems, a Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Additionally, Austria halted the use of one batch of the aforementioned vaccine as well.[276] On 20 March, the WHO and European Medicines Agency found no link between thrombus (a blood clot of clinical importance), leading several European countries to resume administering the AstraZeneca vaccine.[277]
On 29 March, it was reported that the U.S. government was planning to introduce COVID-19 vaccination 'passports' to allow those who have been vaccinated the ability to board aeroplanes, cruise ships as well as other activities.[278]
As of 20 June 2021, more than 178 million cases have been reported worldwide due to COVID-19; more than 3.86 million have died.[3]
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set up border controls.[279] National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines and curfews (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns).[280] The WHO's recommendation on curfews and lockdowns is that they should be short-term measures to reorganise, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect health workers who are exhausted. To achieve a balance between restrictions and normal life, the long-term responses to the pandemic should consist of strict personal hygiene, effective contact tracing, and isolating when ill.[281]
By 26 March 2020, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown,[282] which increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April—more than half the world's population.[283][284]
By late April 2020, around 300 million people were under lockdown in nations of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom, while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America.[285] Nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States,[286] around 100 million people in the Philippines,[285] about 59 million people in South Africa,[287] and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India.[288][289]
As of 30 April 2020,[290] cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for Turkmenistan and North Korea, although these countries likely also have cases.[291][292] Despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak, the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, particularly Bhutan,[293] Singapore,[294][295] Taiwan[296] and Vietnam[297] has allowed them to fare comparatively well. China is criticised for initially minimising the severity of the outbreak, but the delayed wide-scale response has largely contained the disease since March 2020.[298][299][300][301]
In Japan, the pandemic has been believed to have caused direct side effects in regards to mental health. According to the report by the country's National Police Agency, suicides had increased to 2,153 in October. Experts also state that the pandemic has worsened mental health issues due to lockdowns and isolation from family members, among other issues.[302]
As of 14 July 2020, there are 83,545 cases confirmed in China— excluding 114 asymptomatic cases, 62 of which were imported, under medical observation; asymptomatic cases have not been reported prior to 31 March 2020—with 4,634 deaths and 78,509 recoveries,[303] meaning there are only 402 cases. Hubei has the most cases, followed by Xinjiang.[304] By March 2020, COVID-19 infections have largely been put under control in China,[298] with minor outbreaks since.[305] It was reported on 25 November, that some 1 million people in the country of China have been vaccinated according to China's state council; the vaccines against COVID-19 come from Sinopharm which makes two and one produced by Sinovac.[306]
The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported on 30 January 2020. India ordered a nationwide lockdown for the entire population starting 24 March 2020,[307] with a phased unlock beginning 1 June 2020. Six cities account for around half of all reported cases in the country—Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.[308] On 10 June 2020, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.[309]
On 30 August 2020, India surpassed the US record for the most cases in a single day, with more than 78,000 cases,[310] and set a new record on 16 September 2020, with almost 98,000 cases reported that day.[311] As of 30 August 2020, India's case fatality rate is relatively low at 2.3%, against the global 4.7%.[312][needs update]
As of September 2020, India had the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia;[313] and the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world,[314] behind the United States,[315] with the number of total confirmed cases breaching the 100,000 mark on 19 May 2020,[316] 1,000,000 on 16 July 2020,[317] and 5,000,000 confirmed cases on 16 September 2020.[318]
On 19 December 2020, India crossed the total number of 10,000,000 confirmed cases but with a slow pace.[319]
The Indian Ministry of Science initiated a mathematical simulation of the pandemic, the so-called ""Indian Supermodel"", which correctly predicted the decrease of active cases starting in September 2020.[320][5][321][322][323]
A second wave hit India in April 2021, placing healthcare services under severe strain.[324] By late April, the government was reporting over 300,000 new infections and 2,000 deaths per day, with concerns of undercounting.[325]
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections on 19 February 2020 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people had died that day.[327][328] Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events,[329] sporting events,[330] Friday prayers,[331] and closures of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.[332] Iran allocated 5 trillion rials (equivalent to US$120,000,000) to combat the virus.[333] President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.[334] Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March 2020,[335] although heavy traffic between cities ahead of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.[336] Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March.[337][338]
Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus after China in February 2020.[339][340] More than ten countries had traced their cases back to Iran by 28 February, indicating the outbreak may have been more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.[340][341] The Iranian Parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have had tested positive for the virus on 3 March 2020.[342] On 15 March 2020, the Iranian government reported a hundred deaths in a single day, the most recorded in the country since the outbreak began.[343] At least twelve sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease by 17 March 2020.[344] By 23 March 2020, Iran was experiencing fifty new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to COVID-19.[345] According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than what is being reported. It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak.[346]
On 20 April 2020, Iran reopened shopping malls and other shopping areas across the country.[347] After reaching a low in new cases in early May, a new peak was reported on 4 June 2020, raising fear of a second wave.[348] On 18 July 2020, President Rouhani estimated that 25 million Iranians had already become infected, which is considerably higher than the official count.[349] Leaked data suggest that 42,000 people had died with COVID-19 symptoms by 20 July 2020, nearly tripling the 14,405 officially reported by that date.[350]
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China. The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February,[351] largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.[351][352] Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the origin of the outbreak.[353][354] By 22 February, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13 per cent reported symptoms.[355] South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.[356] On 29 February, more than 3,150 confirmed cases were reported.[357] All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests showed three soldiers had the virus.[353] Airline schedules were also changed.[358][359]
South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organised programme in the world to screen the population for the virus, isolate any infected people, and trace and quarantine those who contacted them.[360][361] Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application,[362] drive-through testing for the virus with the results available the next day,[363] and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.[364] Despite some early criticisms of President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis,[365] South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities.[360][366][367]
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day case total in four weeks.[364] On 29 March, it was reported that beginning 1 April all new overseas arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.[368] Per media reports on 1 April, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.[369] Persistent local groups of infections in the greater Seoul area continued to be found, which led to Korea's CDC director saying in June that the country had entered the second wave of infections,[370] although a WHO official disagreed with that assessment.[371]
By 13 March 2020, when the number of reported new cases of COVID-19 became greater than those in China, the World Health Organization (WHO) began to consider Europe the active centre of the COVID-19 pandemic.[372][373] By 22 May 2020, the WHO said that South America was now experiencing a worse outbreak.[374]
By 17 March 2020, all countries within Europe had a confirmed case of COVID-19, with Montenegro being the last European country to report at least one case.[375] At least one death has been reported in all European countries, apart from the Vatican City.
By 18 March 2020, more than 250 million people were in lockdown in Europe.[376]
On 21 August, it was reported the COVID-19 cases were climbing among younger individuals across Europe.[381] On 21 November, it was reported by the Voice of America that Europe is the worst hit area by the COVID-19 virus, with numbers exceeding 15 million cases.[382]
Although it was originally thought the pandemic reached France on 24 January 2020, when the first COVID-19 case in Europe was confirmed in Bordeaux, it was later discovered that a person near Paris had tested positive for the virus on 27 December 2019 after retesting old samples.[248][249] A key event in the spread of the disease in the country was the annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February in Mulhouse, which was attended by about 2,500 people, at least half of whom are believed to have contracted the virus.[383][384]
On 13 March, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe ordered the closure of all non-essential public places,[385] and on 16 March, French President Emmanuel Macron announced mandatory home confinement, a policy which was extended at least until 11 May.[386][387][388] As of 14 September, France has reported more than 402,000 confirmed cases, 30,000 deaths, and 90,000 recoveries,[389] ranking fourth in number of confirmed cases.[390] In April, there were riots in some Paris suburbs.[391] On 18 May, it was reported that schools in France had to close again after reopening, due to COVID-19 case flare-ups.[392]
On 12 November, it was reported that France had become the worst-hit country by the COVID-19 pandemic, in all of Europe, in the process surpassing Russia. The new total of confirmed cases was more than 1.8 million and counting; additionally it was indicated by the French government that the current national lockdown would remain in place.[393]
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.[244] Cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.[394] An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February 2020.[395]
On 22 February 2020, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from eleven different municipalities in northern Italy.[396] Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, ""In the outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided. Suspension of work activities and sports events has already been ordered in those areas.""[397][398]
On 4 March 2020, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached a hundred deaths. All major sporting events were to be held behind closed doors until April,[399] but on 9 March, all sport was suspended completely for at least one month.[400] On 11 March 2020, Prime Minister Conte ordered stoppage of nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies.[401][402]
On 6 March 2020, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols.[403][404][405] On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most COVID-19-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 fatalities from the pandemic.[406][407] On 22 March 2020, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy.[408] As of 28 March, there were 3,532,057 confirmed cases, 107,933 deaths, and 2,850,889 recoveries in Italy, with a large number of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.[3] A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and inability to test all who have the virus to date may be contributing to the high fatality rate.[409] On 19 April 2020, it was reported that the country had its lowest deaths at 433 in seven days and some businesses were asking for a loosening of restrictions after six weeks of lockdown.[410] On 13 October 2020, the Italian government again issued restrictive rules to contain a rise in infections.[411]
On 11 November, it was reported that Silvestro Scotti, president of the Italian Federation of General Practitioners indicated that all of Italy should come under restrictions due to the spread of COVID-19. A couple of days prior Filippo Anelli, president of the National Federation of Doctor's Guilds (FNOMCEO) asked for a complete lockdown of the peninsular nation due to the pandemic.[412] On the 10th, a day before, Italy surpassed 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases.[413] On 23 November, it was reported that the second wave of the virus has caused some hospitals in Italy to stop accepting patients.[414]
The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Spain on 31 January 2020, when a German tourist tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in La Gomera, Canary Islands.[415] Post-hoc genetic analysis has shown that at least 15 strains of the virus had been imported, and community transmission began by mid-February.[416] By 13 March, cases had been confirmed in all 50 provinces of the country.
A lockdown was imposed on 14 March 2020.[417] On 29 March, it was announced that, beginning the following day, all non-essential workers were ordered to remain at home for the next 14 days.[418] By late March, the Community of Madrid has recorded the most cases and deaths in the country. Medical professionals and those who live in retirement homes have experienced especially high infection rates.[419] On 25 March, the official death toll in Spain surpassed that of mainland China.[420] On 2 April, 950 people died of the virus in a 24-hour period—at the time, the most by any country in a single day.[421] On 17 May, the daily death toll announced by the Spanish government fell below 100 for the first time,[422] and 1 June was the first day without deaths by COVID-19.[423] The state of alarm ended on 21 June.[424] However, the number of cases increased again in July in a number of cities including Barcelona, Zaragoza and Madrid, which led to reimposition of some restrictions but no national lockdown.[425][426][427][428]
Sweden differed from most other European countries in that it mostly remained open.[438] Per the Swedish Constitution, the Public Health Agency of Sweden has autonomy which prevents political interference and the agency's policy favoured forgoing a lockdown. The Swedish strategy focused on measures that could be put in place over a longer period of time, based on the assumption that the virus would start spreading again after a shorter lockdown.[439][440] The New York Times said that, as of May 2020, the outbreak had been far deadlier there but the economic impact had been reduced as Swedes have continued to go to work, restaurants, and shopping.[438][441] On 19 May, it was reported that the country had in the week of 12–19 May the highest per capita deaths in Europe, 6.25 deaths per million per day.[442] In the end of June, Sweden no longer had excess mortality.[443]
Devolution in the United Kingdom meant that each of the four countries of the UK had its own different response to COVID-19, and the UK government, on behalf of England, moved quicker to lift restrictions.[444] The UK government started enforcing social distancing and quarantine measures on 18 March 2020[445][446] and was criticised for a perceived lack of intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public.[447][448] On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised against non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.[449][450] On 20 March, the government ordered all leisure establishments to close as soon as possible,[451] and promised to prevent unemployment.[452] On 23 March, Johnson banned gatherings of multiple people and restricting non-essential travel and outdoor activity. Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforceable by police through fines and dispersal of gatherings. Most non-essential businesses were ordered to close.[453]
On 24 April, it was reported that a promising vaccine trial had begun in England; the government pledged more than £50 million towards research.[454] A number of temporary critical care hospitals were built.[455] The first operating was the 4,000-bed NHS Nightingale Hospital London, constructed for over nine days.[456] On 4 May, it was announced that it would be placed on standby and remaining patients transferred to other facilities;[457] 51 patients had been treated in the first three weeks.[458]
On 16 April, it was reported that the UK would have first access to the Oxford vaccine, due to a prior contract; should the trial be successful, some 30 million doses in the UK would be available.[459]
On 2 December, the UK became the first Western country to approve the Pfizer vaccine against the COVID-19 virus; 800,000 doses would be immediately available for use.[460] It was reported on 5 December, that the United Kingdom would begin vaccination against the virus on 8 December, less than a week after having been approved.[461] On 9 December, MHRA stated that any individual with a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, such as an anaphylactoid reaction, should not take the Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19 protection.[462][463]
The first cases in North America were reported in the United States on the 23 January 2020. Cases were reported in all North American countries after Saint Kitts and Nevis confirmed a case on 25 March, and in all North American territories after Bonaire confirmed a case on 16 April.[464]
More than 33.5 million confirmed cases have been reported in the United States since January 2020, resulting in more than 601,000 deaths, the most of any country, and the twentieth-highest per capita worldwide.[468][469] As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control estimated that, as of March 2021, there are a total 114.6 million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population.[470][471] The U.S. has about one-fifth of the world's confirmed cases and deaths. COVID-19 became the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer.[472] U.S. life expectancy dropped from 78.8 years in 2019 to 77.8 years in the first half of 2020.[473]
The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China,[474][475] but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing.[476][477][478][b] Meanwhile, Trump remained optimistic and was accused by his critics of underestimating the severity of the virus.
The pandemic was confirmed to have reached South America on 26 February 2020 when Brazil confirmed a case in São Paulo.[485] By 3 April, all countries and territories in South America had recorded at least one case.[486]
On 13 May 2020, it was reported that Latin America and the Caribbean had reported over 400,000 cases of COVID-19 infection with, 23,091 deaths. On 22 May 2020, citing the rapid increase of infections in Brazil, the WHO declared South America the epicentre of the pandemic.[487][488]
On 20 May, it was reported that Brazil had a record 1,179 deaths in a single day, for a total of almost 18,000 fatalities. With a total number of almost 272,000 cases, Brazil became the country with the third-highest number of cases, following Russia and the United States.[490] On 25 May, Brazil exceeded the number of reported cases in Russia when they reported that 11,687 new cases had been confirmed over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number to over 374,800, with more than 23,400 deaths. President Jair Bolsonaro has created controversy by referring to the virus as a ""little flu"" and frequently speaking out against preventive measures such as lockdowns and quarantines. His attitude towards the outbreak has been likened to that of former U.S. President Trump, with Bolsonaro being called the ""Trump of the Tropics"".[491] Bolsonaro later tested positive for the virus.[492]
In June 2020, the government of Brazil attempted to conceal the actual figures of the COVID-19 active cases and deaths, as it stopped publishing the total number of infections and deaths. On 5 June, Brazil's health ministry took down the official website reflecting the total numbers of infections and deaths. The website was live on 6 June, with only the number of infections of the previous 24 hours. The last official numbers reported about 615,000 infections and over 34,000 deaths.[493] On 15 June, it was reported that the worldwide cases had jumped from seven to eight million in one week, citing Latin America, specifically Brazil as one of the countries where cases are surging, in this case, towards 1 million cases.[494] Brazil briefly paused Phase III trials for the Coronavac COVID-19 vaccine on 10 November after the suicide of a volunteer before resuming on 11 November.[495]
By early 2021, the death toll had climbed to 231,534. The total number of cases on 7 February exceeded 9.5 million. The only countries with worse outbreaks were India and the United States.[496]
The pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Africa on 14 February 2020, with the first confirmed case announced in Egypt.[497][498] The first confirmed case in sub-Saharan Africa was announced in Nigeria at the end of February 2020.[499] Within three months, the virus had spread throughout the continent, as Lesotho, the last African sovereign state to have remained free of the virus, reported a case on 13 May 2020.[500][501] By 26 May, it appeared that most African countries were experiencing community transmission, although testing capacity was limited.[502] Most of the identified imported cases arrived from Europe and the United States rather than from China where the virus originated.[503]
In early June 2021, Africa faced a third wave of Covid infections with cases rising in 14 countries.[504]
The COVID-19 pandemic shook the world's economy, with especially severe economic damage in the United States, Europe, and Latin America.[516] A consensus report by American intelligence agencies in April 2021 concluded, ""Efforts to contain and manage the virus have reinforced nationalist trends globally, as some states turned inward to protect their citizens and sometimes cast blame on marginalized groups."" Furthermore, COVID-19 has inflamed partisanship and polarisation around the world as bitter arguments explode over whom to scapegoat and whom to help first. The risks include further disruption of international trade and the formation of no-entry enclaves.[517]
As a result of the pandemic, many countries and regions imposed quarantines, entry bans, or other restrictions, either for citizens, recent travellers to affected areas,[518] or for all travellers.[519] Together with a decreased willingness to travel, this had a negative economic and social impact on the travel sector. Concerns have been raised over the effectiveness of travel restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19.[520] A study in Science found that travel restrictions had only modestly affected the initial spread of COVID-19, unless combined with infection prevention and control measures to considerably reduce transmissions.[521] Researchers concluded that ""travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic"" and ""restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late"".[522]
The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel zone.[523][524]
Owing to the effective lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei, several countries evacuated their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, primarily through chartered flights of the home nation, with Chinese authorities providing clearance. Canada, the United States, Japan, India,[525] Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.[526] Brazil and New Zealand also evacuated their own nationals and some other people.[527][528] On 14 March 2020, South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative for the virus from Wuhan, while four who showed symptoms were left behind to mitigate risk.[529] Pakistan said it would not evacuate citizens from China.[530]
On 15 February 2020, the U.S. announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess,[531] and on 21 February, Canada evacuated 129 Canadian passengers from the ship.[532] In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran.[533][534] On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.[535]
In June 2020, the Secretary-General of the United Nations launched the ""UN Comprehensive Response to COVID-19"".[536] The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNSC) has been criticised for a slow coordinated response, especially regarding the UN's global ceasefire, which aims to open up humanitarian access to the world's most vulnerable in conflict zones.[537]
The WHO is a leading organisation involved in the global coordination for mitigating the pandemic.
The WHO has spearheaded several initiatives like the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund to raise money for the pandemic response, the UN COVID-19 Supply Chain Task Force, and the solidarity trial for investigating potential treatment options for the disease. The WHO's COVAX vaccine-sharing program aims to distribute 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine for free or at a reduced cost by the end of 2021,[538] and has begun distributing them.
In several countries, protests have risen against governmental restrictive responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as lockdowns. A February 2021 study found that large protest rallies against COVID-19 measures are likely to directly increase the spread of viruses, including COVID-19.[540]
The outbreak is a major destabilising threat to the global economy. One estimate from an expert at Washington University in St. Louis gave a $300+ billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.[541] Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside China.[542][543] On 27 February, due to mounting worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, U.S. stock indexes posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points (the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–08)[544] and all three major indexes ending the week down more than 10 per cent.[545] On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a Negative Outlook.[546] Stocks plunged again due to coronavirus fears, the largest fall being on 16 March.[547]
Lloyd's of London estimated that the global insurance industry will absorb losses of US$204 billion, exceeding the losses from the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season and 11 September attacks, suggesting the COVID-19 pandemic will likely go down in history as the costliest disaster ever in human history.[548]
Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closing of public places including travel attractions, and advice of governments against travel. Numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, and British regional airline Flybe collapsed.[549] The cruise line industry was hard hit,[550] and several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.[551] International mail between some countries stopped or was delayed due to reduced transportation between them or suspension of domestic service.[552]
The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.[553] Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 per cent. North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50–60 per cent drop.[554] This also resulted in a 33–43 per cent drop in foot traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February. Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.[555]
Hundreds of millions of jobs could be lost globally.[556][557] More than 40 million Americans lost their jobs and filed unemployment insurance claims.[558] The economic impact and mass unemployment caused by the pandemic has raised fears of a mass eviction crisis,[559][560] with an analysis by the Aspen Institute indicating between 30 and 40 million Americans are at risk for eviction by the end of 2020.[561][562] According to a report by Yelp, about 60% of U.S. businesses that have closed since the start of the pandemic will stay shut permanently.[563]
According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14–22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been in that situation without the pandemic.[564] According to the World Bank, up to 100 million more people globally could fall into extreme poverty due to the shutdowns.[565][566] The International Labour Organization (ILO) informed that the income generated in the first nine months of 2020 from work across the world dropped by 10.7 per cent, or $3.5 trillion, amidst the COVID-19 outbreak.[567]
The outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, stemming from globally increased usage of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic buying (which in several places led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water), and disruption to factory and logistic operations.[568] The spread of panic buying has been found to stem from perceived threat, perceived scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social psychological factors (e.g. social influence and trust).[569] The technology industry, in particular, has warned of delays to shipments of electronic goods.[570] According to the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protection equipment has risen a hundredfold, leading to prices up to twenty times the normal price and also delays in the supply of medical items of four to six months.[571][572] It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this will endanger health workers.[573]
The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak was worldwide. The virus created a shortage of precursors (raw material) used in the manufacturing of fentanyl and methamphetamine.[574] Price increases and shortages in these illegal drugs have been noticed on the streets of the UK.[575]
The pandemic has disrupted global food supplies and threatens to trigger a new food crisis.[576][577] David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme (WFP), said ""we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months.""[578] Senior officials at the United Nations estimated in April 2020 that an additional 130 million people could starve, for a total of 265 million by the end of 2020.[578][579][580]
In early February 2020, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) ""scrambled"" after a steep decline in oil prices due to lower demand from China.[581] On Monday, 20 April, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) went negative and fell to a record low (minus $37.63 a barrel) due to traders' offloading holdings so as not to take delivery and incur storage costs.[582] June prices were down but in the positive range, with a barrel of West Texas trading above $20.[582]
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting organisations' operations as well as individuals—both employed and independent—globally. By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.[583] Some services continued through digital platforms,[584][585][586] such as live streaming concerts[587] or web-based arts festivals.[588]
Holy Week observances in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent, were cancelled.[585] Many dioceses have recommended older Christians stay home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; services have been made available via radio, online live streaming and television, though some congregations have made provisions for drive-in worship.[585][589][590] With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square emptied of Christian pilgrims,[585] other religious bodies also cancelled in-person services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.[585] Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were later closed,[331][338] while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.[591][592] The 2020 Hajj was limited to around 1,000 selected pilgrims, in contrast to the usual number of over 2 million.[593]
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the worldwide sporting calendar since the Second World War. Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League,[594] 2019–20 Premier League,[595] UEFA Euro 2020, 2020 Major League Baseball season,[596] 2019–20 NBA season,[597] 2019–20 NHL season,[598] and 2020 Arctic Winter Games.[599] The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, which were originally scheduled to start at 24 July 2020, and were postponed by the International Olympic Committee to 23 July 2021.[600][601][602]
The entertainment industry has also been affected, with many music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.[603][604] The Eurovision Song Contest, which was due to be held in Rotterdam, the Netherlands in May, was cancelled; however, the Netherlands was retained as host for 2021.[605][606] Many large theatres such as those on Broadway also suspended all performances.[607]
The large number of people working or learning from home via videoconferencing software led to several new terms and trends, including ""Zoom fatigue"",[608] a decline in demand for formal clothing, and increased fashion focus on masks and clothes for the upper body (the lower body generally not being visible on a videoconference).[609] The term ""doomscrolling"" became more widely used. Online, numerous COVID-19-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to humour and distraction amid the uncertainty.[610]
The pandemic has affected the political systems of multiple countries, causing suspensions of legislative activities,[611] isolations or deaths of multiple politicians,[612] and rescheduling of elections due to fears of spreading the virus.[613]
Although they have broad support among epidemiologists, social distancing measures have been politically controversial in many countries. Intellectual opposition to social distancing has come primarily from writers of other fields, although there are a few heterodox epidemiologists.[614]
On 23 March 2020, United Nations Secretary-General António Manuel de Oliveira Guterres issued an appeal for a global ceasefire in response to the pandemic;[615][616] 172 UN Member States and Observers signed a non-binding statement in support of the appeal in June,[617] and the UN Security Council passed a resolution supporting it in July.[618][619]
The government of China has been criticised by the United States,[620] the UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove,[621] and others[622] for its handling of the pandemic. A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine measures in China, a sign of discontent with their response to the outbreak. Some commentators believed this move was intended to protect CCP general secretary Xi Jinping from the controversy.[623] The U.S. intelligence community claims China intentionally under-reported its number of COVID-19 cases.[624] The Chinese government maintains it has acted swiftly and transparently.[625][626] However, journalists and activists who have reported on the pandemic have been detained by authorities,[627][628] such as Zhang Zhan, who was arrested and tortured for reporting on the pandemic and the detainment of other independent journalists.[629][630][631]
In early March, the Italian government criticised the EU's lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy[632][633]—Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said ""only China responded bilaterally"", not the EU.[634] On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian president Vladimir Putin had the Russian army send military medics, disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.[635] President of Lombardy Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed their gratitude for the aid.[636] Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.[637] Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary.""[638] In early April, Norway and EU states like Romania and Austria started to offer help by sending medical personnel and disinfectant,[639] and Ursula von der Leyen offered an official apology to the country.[640]
The outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid sick leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.[642][643][644] Political analysts believe it may have contributed to Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election.[645][646] Beginning in mid-April 2020, there were protests in several U.S. states against government-imposed business closures and restricted personal movement and association.[647] Simultaneously, protests ensued by essential workers in the form of a general strike.[648] In early October 2020, Donald Trump, his family members, and many other government officials were diagnosed with COVID-19, further disrupting the country's politics.[649]
The planned NATO ""Defender 2020"" military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, was held on a reduced scale.[650][651] The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's general secretary Kate Hudson criticised the exercise, saying ""it jeopardises the lives not only of the troops from the U.S. and the many European countries participating but the inhabitants of the countries in which they are operating.""[652]
The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about two dozen parliament members and fifteen current or former political figures infected.[341][653] Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying they were struggling to fight the outbreak due to a lack of access to international markets from the United States sanctions against Iran.[654] Saudi Arabia, which launched a military intervention in Yemen in March 2015, declared a ceasefire.[655]
Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.[656] South Korea criticised Japan's ""ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts"" after Japan announced anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.[657] South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis; many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.[365]
Some countries have passed emergency legislation in response to the pandemic. Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.[658][659] In the Philippines, lawmakers granted president Rodrigo Duterte temporary emergency powers during the pandemic.[660] In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.[661] In some countries, including Egypt,[662] Turkey,[663] and Thailand,[660] opposition activists and government critics have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic.[664]
In India, journalists criticising the government's response were arrested or issued warnings by police and authorities.[665] Rates of imprisoned or detained journalists increased worldwide, with some being related to the pandemic.[666][667]
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted agricultural and food systems worldwide.[668] COVID-19 hit at a time when hunger or undernourishment was once again on the rise in the world, with an estimated 690 million people already going hungry in 2019.[669] Based on the latest UN estimates, the economic recession triggered by the pandemic may lead to another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, going hungry in 2020.[669][670][671][672] This is mainly due to a lack of access to food – linked to falling incomes, lost remittances and, in some cases, a rise in food prices. In countries that already suffer from high levels of acute food insecurity, it is no longer an issue of access to food alone, but increasingly also one of food production.[668][669]
The pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly impacted food production. As a result, several famines are forecast, which the UN called a crisis ""of biblical proportions,""[673] or ""hunger pandemic.""[674] It is estimated that without intervention 30 million people may die of hunger, with Oxfam reporting that ""12,000 people per day could die from COVID-19 linked hunger"" by the end of 2020.[675][673][676] This pandemic, in conjunction with the 2019–2021 locust infestations and several ongoing armed conflicts, is predicted to form the worst series of famines since the Great Chinese Famine, affecting between 10 and 20 per cent of the global population in some way.[677] 55 countries are reported to be at risk, with three dozen succumbing to crisis-level famines or above in the worst-case scenario.[678] 265 million people are forecast to be in famine conditions, an increase of 125 million due to the pandemic.[675]
The pandemic has severely impacted educational systems globally. Most governments have temporarily closed educational institutions, with many switching to online education. As of September 2020, approximately 1.077 billion learners were affected due to school closures in response to the pandemic. According to UNICEF monitoring, as of March 2020, 53 countries had closed all schools and 27 some, impacting about 61.6 per cent of the world's student population.[679] School closures impact not only students, teachers, and families but have far-reaching economic and societal consequences. They shed light on social and economic issues, including student debt, digital learning, food insecurity, and homelessness, as well as access to childcare, health care, housing, internet, and disability services. The impact has been more severe for disadvantaged children and their families.[citation needed]
The Higher Education Policy Institute conducted a report which discovered that around 63% of students claimed that their mental health had been worsened as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and alongside this 38% demonstrated satisfaction with the accessibility of mental health services. Despite this, the director for policy and advocacy at the institute has explained that it is still unclear as to how and when normality will resume for students regarding their education and living situation.[680]
The pandemic has had many impacts on global health beyond those caused by the COVID-19 disease itself. It has led to a reduction in hospital visits for other reasons. There have been 38 per cent fewer hospital visits for heart attack symptoms in the United States and 40 per cent fewer in Spain.[681] The head of cardiology at the University of Arizona said, ""My worry is some of these people are dying at home because they're too scared to go to the hospital.""[682] There is also concern that people with strokes and appendicitis are not seeking timely treatment.[682] Shortages of medical supplies have impacted people with various conditions.[683]
In several countries there has been a marked reduction of spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, attributable to COVID-19 quarantines, social distancing measures, and recommendations to not engage in casual sex.[684][685] Similarly, in some places, rates of transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses significantly decreased during the pandemic.[686][687][688]
The pandemic has also negatively impacted mental health globally, including increased loneliness resulting from social distancing[689] and depression and domestic violence from lockdowns.[690] As of June 2020, 40% of U.S. adults were experiencing adverse mental health symptoms, with 11% having seriously considered trying to kill themselves in the past month.[691]

The worldwide disruption caused by the pandemic has resulted in numerous positive effects to the environment and climate. The global reduction in modern human activity such as the considerable decline in planned travel was coined anthropause and has caused a large drop in air pollution and water pollution in many regions.[694][695][696][697] In China, lockdowns and other measures resulted in a 25 percent reduction in carbon emissions and 50 percent reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions, which one Earth systems scientist estimated may have saved at least 77,000 lives over two months.[698][699][700][701]
Other positive effects on the environment include governance-system-controlled investments towards a sustainable energy transition and other goals related to environmental protection such as the European Union's seven-year €1 trillion budget proposal and €750 billion recovery plan ""Next Generation EU"" which seeks to reserve 25% of EU spending for climate-friendly expenditure.[702][703][704]
However, due to humans the pandemic has also provided cover for illegal activities such as deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and increased poaching in Africa. The hindering of environmental diplomacy efforts in combination of late capitalism also created economic fallout that some predict will slow investment in green energy technologies.[705][706][707][708][709][710]
Heightened prejudice, xenophobia, and racism have been documented around the world toward people of Chinese and East Asian descent.[711][712][713][714][715] Reports from February 2020 (when most confirmed cases were confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in groups worldwide about Chinese people 'deserving' the virus.[716][717][718] Chinese people and other Asian peoples in the United Kingdom and United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuse and assaults.[719][720][721] Former U.S. President Donald Trump was criticised for referring to the COVID-19 as the ""Chinese Virus"" and ""Kung Flu"", which has been condemned as racist and xenophobic.[722][723][724] On 14 March, an Asian family, including a two-year-old girl, was attacked at knifepoint in Texas in what the FBI has called a COVID-19 related hate crime.[725]
Following the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy (the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia,[726][727] as were people from hotspots in other countries. Discrimination against Muslims in India escalated after public health authorities identified an Islamic missionary (Tablighi Jamaat) group's gathering in New Delhi in early March 2020 as a source of spread.[728] As of late April 2020, Paris had seen riots break out over police treatment of marginalised ethnic groups during the then in-place lockdown.[729] Racism and xenophobia towards southern and south east Asians increased in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.[730][731][732] South Korea's LGBTQ community was blamed by some for the spread of COVID-19 in Seoul.[733][734] In China, some people of African descent were evicted from their homes and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus.[735] This racism and xenophobia was criticised by some foreign governments, diplomatic corps, and the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe.[736]
Age-based discrimination against older adults, while already present before the pandemic, was more prevalent during the pandemic. This has been attributed to their perceived vulnerability to the virus and subsequent physical and social isolation measures, which, coupled with their already reduced social activity, has increased dependency on others. Similarly, limited digital literacy has left the elderly more vulnerable to the effects of isolation, depression, and loneliness.[737]
The pandemic has resulted in many people adapting to massive changes in life, from increased internet commerce activity to the job market. Social distancing has caused increased sales from large e-commerce companies such as Amazon, Alibaba, and Coupang. Online retailers in the US posted 791.70 billion dollars in sales in 2020, an increase of 32.4% from 598.02 billion dollars from the year before.[738] The trend of home delivery orders have increased due to the pandemic, with indoor dining restaurants shutting down due to lockdown orders or low sales.[739][740] Hackers and cybercriminals/scammers have started targeting people due to the massive changes, with some pretending to be part of the CDC, and others using different phishing schemes.[741] Education worldwide has increasingly shifted from physical attendance to video conferencing apps such as Zoom as lockdown measures have resulted in schools being forced to shut down.[742] Due to the pandemic, mass layoffs have occurred in the airline, travel, hospitality, and some other industries. (There were no signs of permanent recovery as of May 2021.)[743][744]
Ongoing COVID-19 research is indexed and searchable in the NIH COVID-19 Portfolio.[745] Some newspaper agencies removed their online paywalls for some or all of their COVID-19-related articles and posts,[746] while scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access.[747][748] Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.[749]
Maps have played a key role in disseminating information concerning the spatial distribution of the disease, especially with the development of dashboards to present data in near real-time. Methods of data visualisation have drawn some criticism, however, in the over-simplification of geographical patterns indicated by choropleth maps that adopt national, rather than local, map scales.[750]
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in misinformation and conspiracy theories about the scale of the pandemic and the origin, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. False information, including intentional disinformation, has been spread through social media, text messaging,[751] and mass media. Journalists have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the pandemic. False information has also been propagated by celebrities, politicians, and other prominent public figures. The spread of COVID-19 misinformation by governments has also been significant.
Commercial scams have claimed to offer at-home tests, supposed preventives, and ""miracle"" cures.[752] Several religious groups have claimed their faith will protect them from the virus.[753] Without evidence, some people have claimed the virus is a bioweapon accidentally or deliberately leaked from a laboratory, a population control scheme, the result of a spy operation, or the side effect of 5G upgrades to cellular networks.[754]

Vaccines (deployment)

A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely celebrated for their role in reducing the spread, severity, and death caused by COVID-19.[citation needed] Prior to the COVID‑19 pandemic, an established body of knowledge existed about the structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). This knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine technologies during early 2020.[1] On 10 January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID, and by 19 March, the global pharmaceutical industry announced a major commitment to address COVID-19.[2]
In Phase III trials, several COVID‑19 vaccines have demonstrated efficacy as high as 95% in preventing symptomatic COVID‑19 infections. As of June 2021, 18 vaccines are authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use: two RNA vaccines (Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna), nine conventional inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, CoronaVac, Covaxin, CoviVac, COVIran Barakat, Minhai-Kangtai, QazVac, and WIBP-CorV), five viral vector vaccines (Sputnik Light, Sputnik V, Oxford–AstraZeneca, Convidecia, and Johnson & Johnson), and two protein subunit vaccines (EpiVacCorona and RBD-Dimer).[3][failed verification] In total, as of March 2021, 308 vaccine candidates are in various stages of development, with 73 in clinical research, including 24 in Phase I trials, 33 in Phase I–II trials, and 16 in Phase III development.[3]
Many countries have implemented phased distribution plans that prioritize those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.[4] Single dose interim use is under consideration to extend vaccination to as many people as possible until vaccine availability improves.[5][6][7]
As of 16 June 2021, 2.5 billion doses of COVID‑19 vaccine have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national health agencies.[8] AstraZeneca anticipates producing 3 billion doses in 2021, Pfizer–BioNTech 1.3 billion doses, and Sputnik V, Sinopharm, Sinovac, and Johnson & Johnson 1 billion doses each. Moderna targets producing 600 million doses and Convidecia 500 million doses in 2021.[9][10] By December 2020, more than 10 billion vaccine doses had been preordered by countries,[11] with about half of the doses purchased by high-income countries comprising 14% of the world's population.[12]
Prior to COVID‑19, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never been produced in less than several years – and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans.[13] However, vaccines have been produced against several animal diseases caused by coronaviruses, including (as of 2003) infectious bronchitis virus in birds, canine coronavirus, and feline coronavirus.[14] Previous projects to develop vaccines for viruses in the family Coronaviridae that affect humans have been aimed at severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Vaccines against SARS[15] and MERS[16] have been tested in non-human animals.
According to studies published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world at that time.[17][18][19] As of 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine proven to be safe and effective against SARS in humans.[20][21] There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.[22] When MERS became prevalent, it was believed that existing SARS research might provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against a MERS-CoV infection.[20][23] As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine which completed Phase I clinical trials in humans,[24] and three others in progress, all being viral-vectored vaccines: two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).[25]
Since January 2020, vaccine development has been expedited via unprecedented collaboration in the multinational pharmaceutical industry and between governments.[26]
Multiple steps along the entire development path are evaluated, including:[13][27]
There have been several unique challenges with COVID-19 vaccine development.
The urgency to create a vaccine for COVID‑19 led to compressed schedules that shortened the standard vaccine development timeline, in some cases combining clinical trial steps over months, a process typically conducted sequentially over years.[28]
Timelines for conducting clinical research – normally a sequential process requiring years – are being compressed into safety, efficacy, and dosing trials running simultaneously over months, potentially compromising safety assurance.[28][29] As an example, Chinese vaccine developers and the government Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention began their efforts in January 2020,[30] and by March were pursuing numerous candidates on short timelines, with the goal to showcase Chinese technology strengths over those of the United States, and to reassure the Chinese people about the quality of vaccines produced in China.[28][31]
The rapid development and urgency of producing a vaccine for the COVID‑19 pandemic may increase the risks and failure rate of delivering a safe, effective vaccine.[32][33][34] Additionally, research at universities is obstructed by physical distancing and closing of laboratories.[35][36]
Vaccines must progress through several phases of clinical trials to test for safety, immunogenicity, effectiveness, dose levels and adverse effects of the candidate vaccine.[37][38] Vaccine developers have to invest resources internationally to find enough participants for Phase II–III clinical trials when the virus has proved to be a ""moving target"" of changing transmission rates across and within countries, forcing companies to compete for trial participants.[39] Clinical trial organizers also may encounter people unwilling to be vaccinated due to vaccine hesitancy[40] or disbelief in the science of the vaccine technology and its ability to prevent infection.[41] As new vaccines are developed during the COVID‑19 pandemic, licensure of COVID‑19 vaccine candidates requires submission of a full dossier of information on development and manufacturing quality.[42][43][44]
Internationally, the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator is a G20 and World Health Organization (WHO) initiative announced in April 2020.[45][46] It is a cross-discipline support structure to enable partners to share resources and knowledge. It comprises four pillars, each managed by two to three collaborating partners: Vaccines (also called ""COVAX""), Diagnostics, Therapeutics, and Health Systems Connector.[47] The WHO's April 2020 ""R&D Blueprint (for the) novel Coronavirus"" documented a ""large, international, multi-site, individually randomized controlled clinical trial"" to allow ""the concurrent evaluation of the benefits and risks of each promising candidate vaccine within 3–6 months of it being made available for the trial."" The WHO vaccine coalition will prioritize which vaccines should go into Phase II and III clinical trials, and determine harmonized Phase III protocols for all vaccines achieving the pivotal trial stage.[48]
National governments have also been involved in vaccine development. Canada announced funding for 96 research vaccine research projects at Canadian companies and universities, with plans to establish a ""vaccine bank"" that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs,[49] and to support clinical trials and develop manufacturing and supply chains for vaccines.[50]
China provided low-rate loans to one vaccine developer through its central bank, and ""quickly made land available for the company"" to build production plants.[29] Three Chinese vaccine companies and research institutes are supported by the government for financing research, conducting clinical trials, and manufacturing.[51]
Great Britain formed a COVID‑19 vaccine task force in April 2020 to stimulate local efforts for accelerated development of a vaccine through collaborations of industry, universities, and government agencies. It encompassed every phase of development from research to manufacturing.[52]
In the United States, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a federal agency funding disease-fighting technology, announced investments to support American COVID‑19 vaccine development, and manufacture of the most promising candidates.[29][53] In May 2020, the government announced funding for a fast-track program called Operation Warp Speed.[54][55]
Large pharmaceutical companies with experience in making vaccines at scale, including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), formed alliances with biotechnology companies, governments, and universities to accelerate progression towards effective vaccines.[29][28]
COVID-19's causative virus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), was isolated in late 2019.[56] Its genetic sequence was published on 11 January 2020, triggering an urgent international response to prepare for an outbreak and hasten development of a preventive COVID-19 vaccine.[57][58][59] Since early 2020, vaccine development has been expedited via unprecedented collaboration in the multinational pharmaceutical industry and between governments.[60] By June 2020, tens of billions of dollars were invested by corporations, governments, international health organizations, and university research groups to develop dozens of vaccine candidates and prepare for global vaccination programs to immunize against COVID‑19 infection.[58][61][62][63] According to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the geographic distribution of COVID‑19 vaccine development shows North American entities to have about 40% of the activity, compared to 30% in Asia and Australia, 26% in Europe, and a few projects in South America and Africa.[57][60]
In February 2020, the WHO said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS‑CoV‑2 to become available in less than 18 months.[64] The rapidly growing infection rate of COVID‑19 worldwide during early 2020 stimulated international alliances and government efforts to urgently organize resources to make multiple vaccines on shortened timelines,[65] with four vaccine candidates entering human evaluation in March (see COVID-19 vaccine § Trial and authorization status).[57][66]
On 24 June 2020, China approved the CanSino vaccine for limited use in the military, and two inactivated virus vaccines for emergency use in high-risk occupations.[67] On 11 August 2020, Russia announced the approval of its Sputnik V vaccine for emergency use, though one month later only small amounts of the vaccine had been distributed for use outside of the phase 3 trial.[68]
The Pfizer–BioNTech partnership submitted an EUA request to the FDA for the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (active ingredient tozinameran) on 20 November 2020.[69][70] On 2 December 2020, the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) gave temporary regulatory approval for the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine,[71][72] becoming the first country to approve this vaccine and the first country in the Western world to approve the use of any COVID‑19 vaccine.[73][74][75] As of 21 December, many countries and the European Union[76] had authorized or approved the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine. Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates granted emergency marketing authorization for BBIBP-CorV, manufactured by Sinopharm.[77][78] On 11 December 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine.[79] A week later, they granted an EUA for mRNA-1273, the Moderna vaccine.[80][81][82][83]
In June 2021, a report revealed that the UB-612 vaccine, developed by the US-based COVAXX, was a venture initiated for profits by the Blackwater founder Erik Prince. In a series of text messages to Paul Behrends, the close associate recruited for the COVAXX project, Prince described the profit-making possibilities in selling the Covid-19 vaccines. COVAXX provided no data from the clinical trials on safety or efficacy. The responsibility of creating distribution networks was assigned to an Abu Dhabi-based entity, which was mentioned as ""Windward Capital"" on the COVAXX letterhead but was actually Windward Holdings. The sole shareholder of the firm, which handled ""professional, scientific and technical activities"", was Erik Prince. In March 2021, COVAXX raised $1.35 billion in a private placement.[86]
As of January 2021, nine different technology platforms – with the technology of numerous candidates remaining undefined[clarification needed] – are under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID‑19.[3][26] Most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials are focused on the coronavirus spike protein and its variants as the primary antigen of COVID‑19 infection.[26] Platforms being developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.[13][26][32][33]
Many vaccine technologies being developed for COVID‑19 are not like vaccines already in use to prevent influenza, but rather are using ""next-generation"" strategies for precise targeting of COVID‑19 infection mechanisms.[26][32][33] Several of the synthetic vaccines use a 2P mutation to lock the spike protein into its prefusion configuration, stimulating an immune response to the virus before it attaches to a human cell.[88] Vaccine platforms in development may improve flexibility for antigen manipulation, and effectiveness for targeting mechanisms of COVID‑19 infection in susceptible population subgroups, such as healthcare workers, the elderly, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.[26][32]
An RNA vaccine contains RNA which, when introduced into a tissue, acts as messenger RNA (mRNA) to cause the cells to build the foreign protein and stimulate an adaptive immune response which teaches the body how to identify and destroy the corresponding pathogen or cancer cells. RNA vaccines often, but not always, use nucleoside-modified messenger RNA. The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a coformulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.[89][90][91][92]
RNA vaccines were the first COVID-19 vaccines to be authorized in the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union.[93][94] As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine[95][96][97] and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.[98][99] As of February 2021, the CVnCoV RNA vaccine from CureVac is awaiting authorization in the EU.[100]
Severe allergic reactions are rare. In December 2020, 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine administration resulted in 175 cases of severe allergic reaction, of which 21 were anaphylaxis.[101] For 4,041,396 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine dose administrations in December 2020 and January 2021, only ten cases of anaphylaxis were reported.[101] The lipid nanoparticles were most likely responsible for the allergic reactions.[101]
These vaccines are examples of non-replicating viral vector vaccines, using an adenovirus shell containing DNA that encodes a SARS‑CoV‑2 protein.[102][103] The viral vector-based vaccines against COVID-19 are non-replicating, meaning that they do not make new virus particles, but rather produce only the antigen which elicits a systemic immune response.[102]
As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine,[104][105][106] the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine,[107] Convidecia, and the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.[108][109]
Convidecia and the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine are both one-shot vaccines which offer less complicated logistics and can be stored under ordinary refrigeration for several months.[110][111]
The Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine uses Ad26 for the first dose, which is the same as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine's only dose, and Ad5 for the second dose. Convidecia uses Ad5 for its only dose.[112]
Inactivated vaccines consist of virus particles that have been grown in culture and then are killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde to lose disease producing capacity, while still stimulating an immune response.[113]
As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the Chinese CoronaVac,[114][115][116] BBIBP-CorV,[117] and WIBP-CorV; the Indian Covaxin; and the Russian CoviVac.[118] Vaccines in clinical trials include the Valneva COVID-19 vaccine.[119][unreliable source?][120]
Subunit vaccines present one or more antigens without introducing whole pathogen particles. The antigens involved are often protein subunits, but can be any molecule that is a fragment of the pathogen.[121]
As of April 2021, the two authorized vaccines of this type are the peptide vaccine EpiVacCorona[122] and RBD-Dimer.[3] Vaccines with pending authorizations include the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine,[123] SOBERANA 02 (a conjugate vaccine), and the Sanofi–GSK vaccine. The V451 vaccine was previously in clinical trials, which were terminated because it was found that the vaccine may potentially cause incorrect results for subsequent HIV testing.[124][125]
Additional types of vaccines that are in clinical trials include virus-like particle vaccines, multiple DNA plasmid vaccines,[126][127][128][129][130][131] at least two lentivirus vector vaccines,[132][133] a conjugate vaccine, and a vesicular stomatitis virus displaying the SARS‑CoV‑2 spike protein.[134]
Oral vaccines and intranasal vaccines are being developed and studied.[135]
Scientists investigated whether existing vaccines for unrelated conditions could prime the immune system and lessen the severity of COVID‑19 infection.[136] There is experimental evidence that the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis has non-specific effects on the immune system, but no evidence that this vaccine is effective against COVID‑19.[137]
Vaccine efficacy is the risk of getting the disease by vaccinated participants in a controlled trial compared with the risk of getting the disease by unvaccinated participants.[139] An efficacy of 0% means that the vaccine does not work (identical to placebo). An efficacy of 50% means that there are half as many cases of infection as in unvaccinated individuals.
It is not straightforward to compare the efficacies of the different vaccines because the trials were run with different populations, geographies, and variants of the virus.[140] In the case of COVID‑19, a vaccine efficacy of 67% may be enough to slow the pandemic, but this assumes that the vaccine confers sterilizing immunity, which is necessary to prevent transmission. Vaccine efficacy reflects disease prevention, a poor indicator of transmissibility of SARS‑CoV‑2 since asymptomatic people can be highly infectious.[141] The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) set a cutoff of 50% as the efficacy required to approve a COVID‑19 vaccine.[142][143] Aiming for a realistic population vaccination coverage rate of 75%, and depending on the actual basic reproduction number, the necessary effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine is expected to need to be at least 70% to prevent an epidemic and at least 80% to extinguish it without further measures, such as social distancing.[144]
In efficacy calculations, symptomatic COVID-19 is generally defined as having both a positive PCR test and at least one or two of a defined list of COVID-19 symptoms, although exact specifications vary between trials.[citation needed] The trial location also affects the reported efficacy because different countries have different prevalences of SARS-CoV-2 variants.[citation needed] Ranges below are 95% confidence intervals unless indicated otherwise, and all values are for all participants regardless of age, according to the references for each of the trials. By definition, the absence of a confidence interval means that the accuracy of the estimates without an associated confidence interval is unknown to the public. Efficacy against severe COVID-19 is the most important, since hospitalizations and deaths are a public health burden whose prevention is a priority.[145] Authorized and approved vaccines have shown the following efficacies:
The real-world studies of vaccine effectiveness measure to which extent a certain vaccine has succeeded in preventing COVID-19 infection, symptoms, hospitalization and death for the vaccinated individuals in a large population under routine conditions that are less than ideal.[165]
While the most immediate goal of vaccination during a pandemic is to protect individuals from disease, a long-term goal is to eventually eradicate it. To do so, the proportion of the population that must be immunized must be greater than the critical vaccination coverage
. This value can be calculated from the basic reproduction number
and the vaccine effectiveness against transmission
as:[185]

Assuming R0 ≈ 2.87 for SARS-CoV-2,[186] then, for example, the required coverage level would be 72% for a vaccine that is 90% effective against transmission.
Using the same relationship, the required effectiveness against transmission can be calculated as:

Assuming the same R0 ≈ 2.87, the required effectiveness against transmission would be, for example, 81% for a realistic coverage level of 75%[144] or 65% for an impossible coverage level of 100%. Less effective vaccines would not be able to eradicate the disease.
As of June 2021, several post-marketing studies have already estimated the effectiveness of some vaccines against asymptomatic infection. Prevention of infection has an impact on slowing transmission (particularly asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic), but the exact extent of this effect is still under investigation.[187]
Some variants of SARS-CoV-2 have increased transmissivity or, more precisely, an increased url-status=live|effective reproduction number, indicating that the basic reproduction number of these variants is increased, requiring greater vaccine coverage, greater vaccine effectiveness against transmission, or a combination of both.
The potential emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant that is moderately or fully resistant to the antibody response elicited by the current generation of COVID-19 vaccines may necessitate modification of the vaccines.[188] Trials indicate many vaccines developed for the initial strain have lower efficacy for some variants against symptomatic COVID-19.[189] As of February 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration believed that all FDA authorized vaccines remained effective in protecting against circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2.[188]
Limited evidence from various preliminary studies reviewed by the WHO have indicated retained efficacy/effectiveness against disease from Alpha with the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, Pfizer–BioNTech and Novavax, with no data for other vaccines yet. Relevant to how vaccines can end the pandemic by preventing asymptomatic infection, they have also indicated retained antibody neutralization against Alpha with most of the widely distributed vaccines (Sputnik V, Pfizer–BioNTech, Moderna, CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, Covaxin), minimal to moderate reduction with the Oxford–AstraZeneca and no data for other vaccines yet.[190]
In December 2020, a new SARS‑CoV‑2 variant, the Alpha variant or lineage B.1.1.7, was identified in the UK.[191]
Early results suggest protection to the variant from the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.[192][193]
One study indicated that the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine had an efficacy of 42–89% against Alpha, versus 71–91% against other variants.[194]
Preliminary data from a clinical trial indicates that the Novavax vaccine is ~96% effective for symptoms against the original variant and ~86% against Alpha.[195]
Limited evidence from various preliminary studies reviewed by the WHO have indicated reduced efficacy/effectiveness against disease from Beta with the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine (possibly substantial), Novavax (moderate), Pfizer–BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson (minimal), with no data for other vaccines yet. Relevant to how vaccines can end the pandemic by preventing asymptomatic infection, they have also indicated possibly reduced antibody neutralization against Beta with most of the widely distributed vaccines (Oxford–AstraZeneca, Sputnik V, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer–BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax; minimal to substantial reduction) except CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV (minimal to modest reduction), with no data for other vaccines yet.[190]
Moderna has launched a trial of a vaccine to tackle the Beta variant or lineage B.1.351.[196] On 17 February 2021, Pfizer announced neutralization activity was reduced by two-thirds for this variant, while stating that no claims about the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing illness for this variant could yet be made.[197] Decreased neutralizing activity of sera from patients vaccinated with the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines against Beta was later confirmed by several studies.[193][198] On 1 April 2021, an update on a Pfizer/BioNTech South African vaccine trial stated that the vaccine was 100% effective so far (i.e., vaccinated participants saw no cases), with six of nine infections in the placebo control group being the Beta varian.[199]
In January 2021, Johnson & Johnson, which held trials for its Ad26.COV2.S vaccine in South Africa, reported the level of protection against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection was 72% in the United States and 57% in South Africa.[200]
On 6 February 2021, the Financial Times reported that provisional trial data from a study undertaken by South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand in conjunction with Oxford University demonstrated reduced efficacy of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine against the variant.[201] The study found that in a sample size of 2,000 the AZD1222 vaccine afforded only ""minimal protection"" in all but the most severe cases of COVID-19.[202] On 7 February 2021, the Minister for Health for South Africa suspended the planned deployment of about a million doses of the vaccine whilst they examine the data and await advice on how to proceed.[202][203]
In March 2021, it was reported that the ""preliminary efficacy"" of the Novavax vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) against Beta for mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19[204] for HIV-negative participants is 51%.[medical citation needed]
Limited evidence from various preliminary studies reviewed by the WHO have indicated likely retained efficacy/effectiveness against disease from Gamma with CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV, with no data for other vaccines yet. Relevant to how vaccines can end the pandemic by preventing asymptomatic infection, they have also indicated retained antibody neutralization against Gamma with Oxford–AstraZeneca and CoronaVac (no to minimal reduction) and slightly reduced neutralization with Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna (minimal to moderate reduction), with no data for other vaccines yet.[190]
The Gamma variant or lineage P.1 variant (also known as 20J/501Y.V3), initially identified in Brazil, seems to partially escape vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.[198]
Limited evidence from various preliminary studies reviewed by the WHO have indicated likely retained efficacy/effectiveness against disease from Delta with the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech, with no data for other vaccines yet. Relevant to how vaccines can end the pandemic by preventing asymptomatic infection, they have also indicated reduced antibody neutralization against Delta with Oxford–AstraZeneca (substantial reduction), Pfizer–BioNTech and Covaxin (modest to moderate reduction), with no data for other vaccines yet.[190]
In October 2020, a new variant was discovered in India, which was named lineage B.1.617. There were very few detections until January 2021, but by April it had spread to at least 20 countries in all continents except Antarctica and South America.[205][206][207] Among some 15 defining mutations, it has spike mutations D111D (synonymous), G142D,[medical citation needed] P681R, E484Q[208] and L452R,[209] the latter two of which may cause it to easily avoid antibodies.[210] The variant has frequently been referred to as a 'Double mutant', even though in this respect it is not unusual.[209] In an update on 15 April 2021, PHE designated lineage B.1.617 as a 'Variant under investigation', VUI-21APR-01.[211] On 6 May 2021, Public Health England escalated lineage B.1.617.2 from a Variant Under Investigation to a Variant of Concern based on an assessment of transmissibility being at least equivalent to the Alpha variant.[212]
Phase I trials test primarily for safety and preliminary dosing in a few dozen healthy subjects, while Phase II trials – following success in Phase I – evaluate immunogenicity, dose levels (efficacy based on biomarkers) and adverse effects of the candidate vaccine, typically in hundreds of people.[37][38] A Phase I–II trial consists of preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, while determining more precise, effective doses.[38] Phase III trials typically involve more participants at multiple sites, include a control group, and test effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease (an ""interventional"" or ""pivotal"" trial), while monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose.[37][38] Definition of vaccine safety, efficacy, and clinical endpoints in a Phase III trial may vary between the trials of different companies, such as defining the degree of side effects, infection or amount of transmission, and whether the vaccine prevents moderate or severe COVID‑19 infection.[39][213][214]
A clinical trial design in progress may be modified as an ""adaptive design"" if accumulating data in the trial provide early insights about positive or negative efficacy of the treatment.[215][216] Adaptive designs within ongoing Phase II–III clinical trials on candidate vaccines may shorten trial durations and use fewer subjects, possibly expediting decisions for early termination or success, avoiding duplication of research efforts, and enhancing coordination of design changes for the Solidarity trial across its international locations.[215][217]
National regulatory authorities have granted emergency use authorizations for fifteen vaccines. Six of those have been approved for emergency or full use by at least one WHO-recognized stringent regulatory authority. Biologic License Applications for the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines have been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[218][219]
As of September 2020, eleven of the vaccine candidates in clinical development use adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity.[26] An immunological adjuvant is a substance formulated with a vaccine to elevate the immune response to an antigen, such as the COVID‑19 virus or influenza virus.[551] Specifically, an adjuvant may be used in formulating a COVID‑19 vaccine candidate to boost its immunogenicity and efficacy to reduce or prevent COVID‑19 infection in vaccinated individuals.[551][552] Adjuvants used in COVID‑19 vaccine formulation may be particularly effective for technologies using the inactivated COVID‑19 virus and recombinant protein-based or vector-based vaccines.[552] Aluminum salts, known as ""alum"", were the first adjuvant used for licensed vaccines, and are the adjuvant of choice in some 80% of adjuvanted vaccines.[552] The alum adjuvant initiates diverse molecular and cellular mechanisms to enhance immunogenicity, including release of proinflammatory cytokines.[551][552]

Notes
As of 17 June 2021, 2.54 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses had been administered worldwide based on official reports from national health agencies collated by Our World in Data.[556]
During a pandemic on the rapid timeline and scale of COVID-19 cases during 2020, international organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), vaccine developers, governments, and industry are evaluating the distribution of the eventual vaccine(s).[557] Individual countries producing a vaccine may be persuaded to favor the highest bidder for manufacturing or provide first-service to their own country.[558][559][560][561] Experts emphasize that licensed vaccines should be available and affordable for people at the frontline of healthcare and having the greatest need.[558][559][561] In April 2020, it was reported that the UK agreed to work with 20 other countries and global organizations including France, Germany and Italy to find a vaccine and to share the results and that UK citizens would not get preferential access to any new COVID‑19 vaccines developed by taxpayer-funded UK universities.[562] Several companies plan to initially manufacture a vaccine at artificially low pricing, then increase prices for profitability later if annual vaccinations are needed and as countries build stock for future needs.[561]
An April 2020 CEPI report stated: ""Strong international coordination and cooperation between vaccine developers, regulators, policymakers, funders, public health bodies, and governments will be needed to ensure that promising late-stage vaccine candidates can be manufactured in sufficient quantities and equitably supplied to all affected areas, particularly low-resource regions.""[563] The WHO and CEPI are developing financial resources and guidelines for global deployment of several safe, effective COVID‑19 vaccines, recognizing the need is different across countries and population segments.[557][564][565][566] For example, successful COVID‑19 vaccines would likely be allocated first to healthcare personnel and populations at greatest risk of severe illness and death from COVID‑19 infection, such as the elderly or densely-populated impoverished people.[567][568]
In a meeting in April 2021, the World Health Organization's emergency committee addressed concerns of persistent inequity in the global vaccine distribution.[571] Although 9 percent of the world's population lives in the 29 poorest countries, these countries received only 0.3% of all vaccines administered as of May 2021.[572] Locally, in a Agência Pública article from March 15, 2021, Brazil vaccinated twice more white than black people and noticed the fact that the mortality of COVID-19 is bigger in the black population.[573]
On 4 February 2020, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar published a notice of declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID‑19, covering ""any vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate COVID‑19, or the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or a virus mutating therefrom"", and stating that the declaration precludes ""liability claims alleging negligence by a manufacturer in creating a vaccine, or negligence by a health care provider in prescribing the wrong dose, absent willful misconduct"".[574] The declaration is effective in the United States through 1 October 2024.[574]
In December 2020, the UK government granted Pfizer legal indemnity for its COVID-19 vaccine.[575]
In the European Union, the COVID‑19 vaccines are licensed under a Conditional Marketing Authorisation which does not exempt manufacturers from civil and administrative liability claims.[576] While the purchasing contracts with vaccine manufacturers remain secret, they do not contain liability exemptions even for side-effects not known at the time of licensure.[577]
The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit news organization, reported in an investigation that unnamed officials in some countries, such as Argentina and Brazil, said that Pfizer demanded guarantees against costs of legal cases due to adverse effects in the form of liability waivers and sovereign assets such as federal bank reserves, embassy buildings or military bases, going beyond the expected from other countries such as the US.[578] During the pandemic parliamentary inquiry in Brazil, Pfizer's representative said that its terms for Brazil are the same as for all other countries with which it has signed deals.[579]
While vaccines substantially reduce the probability of infection, it is still possible for fully vaccinated people to contract and spread COVID-19.[167] Public health agencies have recommended that vaccinated people continue using preventive measures (wear face masks, social distance, wash hands) to avoid infecting others, especially vulnerable people, particularly in areas with high community spread. Governments have indicated that such recommendations will be reduced as vaccination rates increase and community spread declines.[580]
Nations pledged to buy doses of COVID‑19 vaccine before the doses were available. Though high-income nations represent only 14% of the global population, as of 15 November 2020, they had contracted to buy 51% of all pre-sold doses. Some high-income nations bought more doses than would be necessary to vaccinate their entire populations.[12]
On 18 January 2021, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned of problems with equitable distribution: ""More than 39 million doses of vaccine have now been administered in at least 49 higher-income countries. Just 25 doses have been given in one lowest-income country. Not 25 million; not 25 thousand; just 25.""[581]
In March, it was revealed the US attempted to convince Brazil not to purchase the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, fearing ""Russian influence"" in Latin America.[582] Some nations involved in long-standing territorial disputes have reportedly had their access to vaccines blocked by competing nations; Palestine has accused Israel blocking vaccine delivery to Gaza, while Taiwan has suggested that China has hampered its efforts to procure vaccine doses.[583][584][585]
A single dose of the COVID‑19 vaccine by AstraZeneca would cost 47 Egyptian pounds (EGP) and the authorities are selling it between 100 and 200 EGP. A report by Carnegie Endowment for International Peace cited the current poverty rate in Egypt as around 29.7 percent, which constitutes approximately 30.5 million people, and claimed that about 15 million of the Egyptians would be unable to gain access to the luxury of vaccination. A human rights lawyer, Khaled Ali launched a lawsuit against the government, forcing them to provide vaccination free of cost to all members of the public.[586]
According to immunologist Dr. Anthony Fauci, mutant strains of virus and limited vaccine distribution pose continuing risks and he said: ""we have to get the entire world vaccinated, not just our own country.""[587] Edward Bergmark and Arick Wierson are calling for an global vaccination effort and wrote that the wealthier nations' ""me-first"" mentality could ultimately backfire, because the spread of the virus in poorer countries would lead to more variants, against which current vaccines could be less effective.[588]
On 10 March 2021, the United States, Britain, European Union nations and other WTO members, blocked a push by more than eighty developing countries to waive COVID‑19 vaccine patent rights in an effort to boost production of vaccines for poor nations.[589] On 5 May 2021, the Biden administration announced that it supports waiving intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines.[590] The Members of the European Parliament have backed a motion demanding the temporary lifting of intellectual properties rights for Covid-19 vaccines.[591] Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, stressed that while the EU is ready to discuss the issue of patent waivers, its proposed solutions include limiting export restrictions, resolving production bottlenecks, looking into compulsory licensing, investing in manufacturing capacity in developing countries and increasing contributions to the COVAX scheme.[592]
In May 2021, UNICEF made an urgent appeal to industrialised nations to pool their excess COVID-19 vaccine capacity to make up for a 125-million-dose gap in the COVAX program. The program mostly relied on the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine produced by SRI, which faced serious supply problems due to increased domestic vaccine needs in India from March to June 2021. Currently, only a limited amount of vaccines can be distributed efficiently, and the shortfall of vaccines in South America and parts of Asia are due to a lack of expedient donations by richer nations. International aid organisations have pointed at Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Maldives as well as Argentina and Brazil, and some parts of the Caribbean as problem areas, where vaccines are in short supply. UNICEF has also been critical towards proposed donations of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines since these are not slated for delivery until the second half of 2021, or early 2022.[593]
Some 10% of the public perceives vaccines as unsafe or unnecessary, refusing vaccination – a global health threat called vaccine hesitancy[594] – which increases the risk of further viral spread that could lead to COVID‑19 outbreaks.[40] As of May 2020, estimates from two surveys were that 67% or 80% of people in the U.S. would accept a new vaccination against COVID‑19, with wide disparity by education level, employment status, ethnicity, and geography.[595] In March 2021, 19% of US adults claimed to have been vaccinated while 50% announced plans to get vaccinated.[596][597]
In an effort to demonstrate the vaccine's safety, prominent politicians have received it on camera, with others pledging to do so.[598][599][600]
Many public figures and celebrities have publicly declared that they have been vaccinated against COVID‑19, and encouraged people to get vaccinated. Many have made video recordings or otherwise documented their vaccination. They do this partly to counteract vaccine hesitancy and COVID‑19 vaccine conspiracy theories.[601]
Several current and former heads of state and government ministers have released photographs of their vaccinations, encouraging others to be vaccinated, including Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Zdravko Marić, Olivier Véran, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, the Dalai Lama, Narendra Modi, Justin Trudeau, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris.[602][603]
Elizabeth II and Prince Philip announced they had the vaccine, breaking from protocol of keeping the British royal family's health private.[601] Pope Francis and Pope Emeritus Benedict both announced they had been vaccinated.[601]
Dolly Parton recorded herself getting vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine she helped fund, she encouraged people to get vaccinated and created a new version of her song ""Jolene"" called ""Vaccine"".[601] Patti Smith, Yo-Yo Ma, Carole King, Tony Bennett, Mavis Staples, Brian Wilson, Joel Grey, Loretta Lynn, Willie Nelson, and Paul Stanley have all released photographs of them being vaccinated and encouraged others to do so.[602] Grey stated ""I got the vaccine because I want to be safe. We've lost so many people to COVID. I've lost a few friends. It's heartbreaking. Frightening.""[602]
Amy Schumer, Rosario Dawson, Arsenio Hall, Danny Trejo, Mandy Patinkin, Samuel L. Jackson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Kate Mulgrew, Jeff Goldblum, Jane Fonda, Anthony Hopkins, Bette Midler, Kim Cattrall, Isabella Rossellini, Christie Brinkley, Cameran Eubanks, Hugh Bonneville, Alan Alda, David Harbour, Sean Penn, Amanda Kloots, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart have released photographs of themselves getting vaccinated and encouraging others to do the same.[601][602] Dame Judi Dench and Joan Collins announced they have been vaccinated.[601]
Martha Stewart, Jonathan Van Ness, Al Roker and Dan Rather released photographs of themselves getting vaccinated and encouraged others to do the same.[601][602] Stephen Fry also shared a photograph of being vaccinated; he wrote, ""It's a wonderful moment, but you feel that it's not only helpful for your own health, but you know that you're likely to be less contagious if you yourself happen to carry it ... It's a symbol of being part of society, part of the group that we all want to protect each other and get this thing over and done with.""[601] Sir David Attenborough announced that he has been vaccinated.[601]
Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar released photographs of themselves getting vaccinated and encouraged others to do the same; Abdul-Jabbar said, ""We have to find new ways to keep each other safe.""[602]
Romesh Ranganathan, Meera Syal, Adil Ray, Sadiq Khan and others produced a video specifically encouraging ethnic minority communities in the UK to be vaccinated including addressing conspiracy theories stating ""there is no scientific evidence to suggest it will work differently on people from ethnic minorities and that it does not include pork or any material of fetal or animal origin.""[604]
Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg have spoken about being vaccinated and encouraged other black Americans to be so.[602] Stephanie Elam volunteered to be a trial volunteer stating ""a large part of the reason why I wanted to volunteer for this COVID‑19 vaccine research – more Black people and more people of color need to be part of these trials so more diverse populations can reap the benefits of this medical research.""[602]

3,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2)[2] is the virus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.[3] Also colloquially known simply as the coronavirus, it was previously referred to by its provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),[4][5][6][7] and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19).[8][9][10][11] The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.[12][13] SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus[14] that is contagious in humans.[15] As described by the US National Institutes of Health, it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[16]
SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV).[2] It is believed to have zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus.[9][17] Research is ongoing as to whether SARS‑CoV‑2 came directly from bats or indirectly through any intermediate hosts.[18] The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS‑CoV‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019.[19]
Epidemiological studies estimate that each infection results in an average of 2.39 to 3.44 new ones when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures are taken.[20] The virus primarily spreads between people through close contact and via aerosols and respiratory droplets that are exhaled when talking, breathing, or otherwise exhaling, as well as those produced from coughs or sneezes.[21][22] It mainly enters human cells by binding to a membrane protein that regulates the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)).[23][24]
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, various names were used for the virus; some names used by different sources included the ""coronavirus"" or ""Wuhan coronavirus"".[25][26] In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended ""2019 novel coronavirus"" (2019-nCov)[5][27] as the provisional name for the virus. This was in accordance with WHO's 2015 guidance[28] against using geographical locations, animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names.[29][30]
On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official name ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS‑CoV‑2).[31] To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS‑CoV‑2 as ""the COVID-19 virus"" in public health communications[32][33] and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles.[8][9][10]
Human-to-human transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2 was confirmed on 20 January 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[15][34][35][36] Transmission was initially assumed to occur primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 1.8 metres (6 ft).[37][38] Laser light scattering experiments suggest that speaking is an additional mode of transmission[39][40] and a far-reaching[41] and under-researched[42] one, indoors, with little air flow.[43][44] Other studies have suggested that the virus may be airborne as well, with aerosols potentially being able to transmit the virus.[45][46][47] During human-to-human transmission, an average 1000 infectious SARS‑CoV‑2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection.[48][49]
Indirect contact via contaminated surfaces is another possible cause of infection.[50] Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, but does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours;[10] the virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises its lipid bilayer.[51][52] Viral RNA has also been found in stool samples and semen from infected individuals.[53][54]
The degree to which the virus is infectious during the incubation period is uncertain, but research has indicated that the pharynx reaches peak viral load approximately four days after infection[55][56] or the first week of symptoms, and declines after.[57] The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding is generally between 3 and 46 days after symptom onset.[58]
A study by a team of researchers from the University of North Carolina found that the nasal cavity is seemingly the dominant initial site for infection with subsequent aspiration-mediated virus seeding into the lungs in SARS‑CoV‑2 pathogenesis.[59] They found that there was an infection gradient from high in proximal towards low in distal pulmonary epithelial cultures, with a focal infection in ciliated cells and type 2 pneumocytes in the airway and alveolar regions respectively.[59]
There is some evidence of human-to-animal transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2, including examples in felids.[60][61] Some institutions have advised those infected with SARS‑CoV‑2 to restrict contact with animals.[62][63]
On 1 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that ""transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission"".[64] One meta-analysis found that 17% of infections are asymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals were 42% less likely to transmit the virus.[65]
However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the outbreak in China suggested that ""pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections"" and that subclinical infections may have been the source of a majority of infections.[66] That may explain how out of 217 onboard a cruise liner that docked at Montevideo, only 24 of 128 who tested positive for viral RNA showed symptoms.[67] Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients shed the greatest amount of virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that ""a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the index case"".[68]
There is uncertainty about reinfection and long-term immunity.[69] It is not known how common reinfection is, but reports have indicated that it is occurring with variable severity.[69]
The first reported case of reinfection was a 33-year-old man from Hong Kong who first tested positive on 26 March 2020, was discharged on 15 April 2020 after two negative tests, and tested positive again on 15 August 2020 (142 days later), which was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing showing that the viral genomes between the episodes belong to different clades.[70] The findings had the implications that herd immunity may not eliminate the virus if reinfection is not an uncommon occurrence and that vaccines may not be able to provide lifelong protection against the virus.[70]
Another case study described a 25-year-old man from Nevada who tested positive for SARS‑CoV‑2 on 18 April 2020 and on 5 June 2020 (separated by two negative tests). Since genomic analyses showed significant genetic differences between the SARS‑CoV‑2 variant sampled on those two dates, the case study authors determined this was a reinfection.[71] The man's second infection was symptomatically more severe than the first infection, but the mechanisms that could account for this are not known.[71]

The first known infections from SARS‑CoV‑2 were discovered in Wuhan, China.[17] The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event.[19][72][9] Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market,[73][74] it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market.[9][75] However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.[19][76] A March 2021 WHO report on a joint WHO–China study stated that human spillover via an intermediate animal host was the most likely explanation, with direct spillover from bats next most likely. Introduction through the food supply chain and the Huanan Seafood Market was considered another possible, but less likely, explanation.[77]
The mutation rate estimated from early cases of SARS-CoV-2 was of 6.54×10−4 per site per year.[77] Its viral evolution is slowed by the RNA proofreading capability of its replication machinery.[78]
Research into the natural reservoir of the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak has resulted in the discovery of many SARS-like bat coronaviruses, most originating in the Rhinolophus genus of horseshoe bats. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that samples taken from Rhinolophus sinicus show a resemblance of 80% to SARS‑CoV‑2.[79][80][81] Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from Rhinolophus affinis, collected in Yunnan province and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS‑CoV‑2.[17][82] The RaTG13 virus sequence is the closest known sequence to SARS-CoV-2.[77] Other closely-related sequences were also identified in samples from local bat populations.[83]
Bats are considered the most likely natural reservoir of SARS‑CoV‑2,[84][85] but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS‑CoV‑2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host;[75] although the source of introduction into humans remains unknown.[86]
Although the role of pangolins as an intermediate host was initially posited (a study published in July 2020 suggested that pangolins are an intermediate host of SARS‑CoV‑2-like coronaviruses[87][88]), subsequent studies have not substantiated their contribution to the spillover.[77] Evidence against this hypothesis includes the fact that pangolin virus samples are too distant to SARS-CoV-2: isolates obtained from pangolins seized in Guangdong were only 92% identical in sequence to the SARS‑CoV‑2 genome. In addition, despite similarities in a few critical amino acids,[89] pangolin virus samples exhibit poor binding to the human ACE2 receptor.[90]
SARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses.[26] It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. Coronaviruses infect humans, other mammals, and avian species, including livestock and companion animals.[91] Human coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, fatality rate ~34%). SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV.[92]
Like the SARS-related coronavirus implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS‑CoV‑2 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B).[93][94] Coronaviruses also undergo frequent recombination.[95] Its RNA sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length,[96] relatively long for a coronavirus (which in turn carry the largest genomes among all RNA families)[97] Its genome consists nearly entirely of protein-coding sequences, a trait shared with other coronaviruses.[95]
A distinguishing feature of SARS‑CoV‑2 is its incorporation of a polybasic site cleaved by furin,[89] which appears to be an important element enhancing its virulence.[98] The furin protease recognizes the canonical peptide sequence RX[R/K]R↓X where the cleavage site is indicated by a down arrow and X is any amino acid.[99][100] In SARS-CoV-2 the recognition site is formed by the incorporated 12 codon nucleotide sequence CCT CGG CGG GCA which corresponds to the amino acid sequence PRRA.[101] This sequence is upstream of an arginine and serine which forms the S1/S2 cleavage site (PRRAR↓S) of the spike protein.[102] Although such sites are a common naturally-occurring feature of other viruses,[101] including some members of the Beta-CoV genus and other genera of coronaviruses,[103] SARS-Cov-2 is unique among members of its subgenus for such a site.[89]
Viral genetic sequence data can provide critical information about whether viruses separated by time and space are likely to be epidemiologically linked.[104] With a sufficient number of sequenced genomes, it is possible to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of the mutation history of a family of viruses. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS‑CoV‑2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and other institutions;[96][105] the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020.[106] A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were ""highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor"", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019.[106] Examination of the topology of the phylogenetic tree at the start of the pandemic also found high similarities between human isolates.[107] As of 7 May 2020, 4,690 SARS‑CoV‑2 genomes sampled on six continents were publicly available.[108][clarification needed]
On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses based on five conserved sequences of nucleic acids, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the virus from the 2003 SARS outbreak were insufficient to make them separate viral species. Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a virus of Severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus.[109]
In July 2020, scientists reported that a more infectious SARS‑CoV‑2 variant with spike protein variant G614 has replaced D614 as the dominant form in the pandemic.[110][111]
Coronavirus genomes and subgenomes encode six open reading frames (ORFs).[112] In October 2020, researchers discovered a possible overlapping gene named ORF3d, in the SARS‑CoV‑2 genome. It is unknown if the protein produced by ORF3d has any function, but it provokes a strong immune response. ORF3d has been identified before, in a variant of coronavirus that infects pangolins.[113][114]
A phylogenetic tree based on whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses is:[115][116][117]

There are many thousands of variants of SARS-CoV-2, which can be grouped into the much larger clades.[123] Several different clade nomenclatures have been proposed. Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).[124]
Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2020. The World Health Organization has currently declared four variants of concern, which are as follows:[125]
Other notable variants include 6 other WHO-designated variants under investigation and Cluster 5, which emerged among mink in Demark and resulted in a mink euthanasia campaign rendering it virtually extinct.[126]
Each SARS-CoV-2 virion is 50–200 nanometres in diameter.[74] Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the viral envelope.[127] Coronavirus S proteins are glycoproteins that are divided into two functional parts (S1 and S2).[91] In SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using cryogenic electron microscopy,[128][129] is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell;[127] specifically, its S1 subunit catalyzes attachment, the S2 subunit fusion.[130]
SARS-CoV-2 has a linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome about 30,000 bases long.[91] Its genome has a bias against cytosine (C) and guanine (G) nucleotides like other coronaviruses.[131] The genome has the highest composition of U (32.2%), followed by A (29.9%), and a similar composition of G (19.6%) and C (18.3%).[132] The nucleotide bias arises from the mutation of guanines and cytosines to adenosines and uracils, respectively.[133] The mutation of CG dinucleotides is thought to arise to avoid the zinc finger antiviral protein related defense mechanism of cells,[134] and to lower the energy to unbind the genome during replication and translation (adenosine and uracil base pair via two hydrogen bonds, cytosine and guanine via three).[133] The depletion of CG dinucleotides in its genome has led the virus to have a noticeable codon usage bias. For instance, arginine's six different codons have a relative synonymous codon usage of AGA (2.67), CGU (1.46), AGG (.81), CGC (.58), CGA (.29), and CGG (.19).[132] A similar codon usage bias trend is seen in other SARS–related coronaviruses.[135]
Virus infections start when viral particles bind to host surface cellular receptors.[136] Protein modeling experiments on the spike protein of the virus soon suggested that SARS‑CoV‑2 has sufficient affinity to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on human cells to use them as a mechanism of cell entry.[137] By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using reverse genetics methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS‑CoV‑2.[17][138][139][140] Studies have shown that SARS‑CoV‑2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus.[128][141] SARS‑CoV‑2 May also use basigin to assist in cell entry.[142]
Initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS‑CoV‑2.[23] The host protein neuropilin 1 (NRP1) may aid the virus in host cell entry using ACE2.[143] After a SARS‑CoV‑2 virion attaches to a target cell, the cell's TMPRSS2 cuts open the spike protein of the virus, exposing a fusion peptide in the S2 subunit, and the host receptor ACE2.[130] After fusion, an endosome forms around the virion, separating it from the rest of the host cell. The virion escapes when the pH of the endosome drops or when cathepsin, a host cysteine protease, cleaves it.[130] The virion then releases RNA into the cell and forces the cell to produce and disseminate copies of the virus, which infect more cells.[144]
SARS‑CoV‑2 produces at least three virulence factors that promote shedding of new virions from host cells and inhibit immune response.[127] Whether they include downregulation of ACE2, as seen in similar coronaviruses, remains under investigation (as of May 2020).[145]
Based on the low variability exhibited among known SARS‑CoV‑2 genomic sequences, health authorities likely detected the virus within weeks of its emergence among the human population in late 2019.[19][146] The earliest case of infection currently known is dated to 1 December 2019, although an earlier case could have occurred on 17 November 2019.[147][148] The pandemic onset was estimated by tMRCA analysis to have occurred before the end of December 2019, but this statistical inference do not provide definitive proof of time of origins.[77] The virus subsequently spread to all provinces of China and to more than 150 other countries across the world.[149] Human-to-human transmission of the virus has been confirmed in all these regions.[150] On 30 January 2020, SARS‑CoV‑2 was designated a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO,[151][12] and on 11 March 2020 the WHO declared it a pandemic.[13][152]
Retrospective tests collected within the Chinese surveillance system revealed no clear indication of substantial unrecognized circulation of SARS‑CoV‑2 in Wuhan during the latter part of 2019.[153]
A meta-analysis from November 2020 estimated the basic reproduction number (
) of the virus to be between 2.39 and 3.44.[20] This means each infection from the virus is expected to result in 2.39 to 3.44 new infections when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures are taken. The reproduction number may be higher in densely populated conditions such as those found on cruise ships.[154] Many forms of preventive efforts may be employed in specific circumstances to reduce the propagation of the virus.[112]
There have been about 96,000 confirmed cases of infection in mainland China.[149] While the proportion of infections that result in confirmed cases or progress to diagnosable disease remains unclear,[155] one mathematical model estimated that 75,815 people were infected on 25 January 2020 in Wuhan alone, at a time when the number of confirmed cases worldwide was only 2,015.[156] Before 24 February 2020, over 95% of all deaths from COVID-19 worldwide had occurred in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.[157][158] As of 20 June 2021, the percentage had decreased to 0.083%.[149]
As of 20 June 2021, there have been 178,315,490 total confirmed cases of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection in the ongoing pandemic.[149] The total number of deaths attributed to the virus is 3,862,120.[149]

4,COVID-19 misinformation,"




By industry
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in misinformation and conspiracy theories about the scale of the pandemic and the origin, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. False information, including intentional disinformation, has been spread through social media, text messaging,[1] and mass media. Journalists have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the pandemic. False information has also been propagated by celebrities, politicians, and other prominent public figures. The spread of COVID-19 misinformation by governments has also been significant.
Commercial scams have claimed to offer at-home tests, supposed preventives, and ""miracle"" cures.[2] Several religious groups have claimed their faith will protect them from the virus.[3] Without evidence, some people have claimed the virus is a bioweapon accidentally or deliberately leaked from a laboratory, a population control scheme, the result of a spy operation, or the side effect of 5G upgrades to cellular networks.[4]
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared an ""infodemic"" of incorrect information about the virus that poses risks to global health.[5] While belief in conspiracy theories is not a new phenomenon, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this can lead to adverse health effects. Cognitive biases, such as jumping to conclusions and confirmation bias, may be linked to the occurrence of conspiracy beliefs.[6]
On 30 January 2020, the BBC reported on the growing number of conspiracy theories and bad health advice regarding COVID-19. Notable examples at the time included false health advice shared on social media and private chats, as well as conspiracy theories such as the outbreak being planned with the participation of the Pirbright Institute.[7][8] On 31 January, The Guardian listed seven instances of misinformation, adding the conspiracy theories about bioweapons and the link to 5G technology, and including varied false health advice.[9]
In an attempt to speed up research sharing, many researchers have turned to preprint servers such as arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and SSRN. Papers are uploaded to these servers without peer review or any other editorial process that ensures research quality. Some of these papers have contributed to the spread of conspiracy theories. The most notable case was an unreviewed preprint paper uploaded to bioRxiv which claimed that the virus contained HIV ""insertions."" Following objections, the paper was withdrawn.[10][11][12] Preprints about COVID-19 have been extensively shared online and some data suggest that they have been used by the media almost 10 times more than preprints on other topics.[13]
According to a study published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, most misinformation related to COVID-19 involves ""various forms of reconfiguration, where existing and often true information is spun, twisted, recontextualised, or reworked""; less misinformation ""was completely fabricated."" The study also found that ""top-down misinformation from politicians, celebrities, and other prominent public figures"", while accounting for a minority of the samples, captured a majority of the social media engagement. According to their classification, the largest category of misinformation (39%) was ""misleading or false claims about the actions or policies of public authorities, including government and international bodies like the WHO or the UN.""[14]
A natural experiment—an experiment that takes place spontaneously, without human design or intervention—shows a potential link between coronavirus misinformation and increased infection and death. There was one instance of this reported where two similar television news shown on the same network were compared. One reported the effects of coronavirus more seriously and about a month earlier than the other. People and groups exposed to the news show reporting the effects later had higher infection and death rates.[15]
Misinformation on this subject has been used by politicians, interest groups, and state actors in many countries for political purposes: to avoid responsibility, scapegoat other countries, and avoid criticism of their earlier decisions. Sometimes there is a financial motive as well.[16][17][18] A number of countries have been accused of spreading disinformation with state-backed operations in the social media in other countries to generate panic, sow distrust, and undermine democratic debate in other countries, or to promote their models of government.[19][20][21][22]
A Cornell University study of 38 million articles in English-language media around the world found that US President Donald Trump was the single largest driver of the misinformation.[23][24]
While the most likely origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a natural crossover from animals, having spilled-over into the human population from bats, possibly through an intermediate animal host, the precise origin of the virus has not been identified.[25][26][27][28]
An alternative hypothesis under investigation is that the virus may have accidentally escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the course of standard research, although many leading virologists consider this to be unlikely.[29]
Unsubstantiated speculation and conspiracy theories related to this topic have gained popularity during the pandemic. Common conspiracy theories state that the virus was intentionally engineered, either as a bio-weapon or to profit from the sale of vaccines. According to the World Health Organization, genetic manipulation has been ruled out by genomic analysis.[30][27][31] Many other origin stories have also been told, ranging from claims of secret plots by political opponents to a conspiracy theory about mobile phones. The Pew Research Center found, for example, that one in three Americans believed the new coronavirus had been created in a lab; one in four thought it had been engineered intentionally.[32]
The promotion of misinformation has been used by the American far-right and others to stoke anti-China sentiments,[33][34] and has led to increased anti-Asian activity on social media and in the real world.[35] This has also resulted in the bullying of scientists and public health officials, both online and in-person,[36][37][38][39] fueled by a highly political and oftentimes toxic debate on many issues.[40] Such spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories has the potential to negatively affect public health and diminish trust in governments and medical professionals.[41]
The resurgence of the lab leak and other theories was fueled in part by the publication, in May 2021, of early emails between Fauci and scientists discussing the issue. Per the emails in question, Kristian Andersen (author of one study debunking genomic manipulation theories) had heavily considered the possibility, and emailed Fauci proposing possible mechanisms, before ruling out deliberate manipulation with deeper technical analysis.[42][43] These emails were later misconstrued and used by critics to claim a conspiracy was occurring.[44][45]
One early source of the bio-weapon origin theory was former Israeli secret service officer Dany Shoham, who gave an interview to The Washington Times about the Wuhan laboratory.[46][47] One scientist from Hong Kong, Li-Meng Yan, fled China and released a preprint stating the virus was modified in a lab rather than having a natural evolution. In an ad hoc peer-review (the paper was not submitted for traditional peer review as part of the standard scientific publishing process), her claims were labelled as misleading, not scientific, and an unethical promotion of ""essentially conspiracy theories that are not founded in fact.""[48] Yan's paper was funded by the Rule of Law Society and the Rule of Law Foundation, two non-profits linked to Steve Bannon, a former Trump strategist, and Guo Wengui, an expatriate Chinese billionaire.[49] This misinformation was further seized on by the American far-right, who have been known to promote distrust of China. In effect, this formed ""a fast-growing echo chamber for misinformation.""[33] The idea of SARS-CoV-2 as a lab-engineered weapon is an element of the Plandemic conspiracy theory, which proposes that it was deliberately released by China.[50]
In response to the propagation of theories in the US of a Wuhan lab origin, the Chinese government promulgated the conspiracy theory that the virus was developed by the United States army at Fort Detrick.[51]
One idea used to support a laboratory origin invokes previous gain of function research on coronaviruses. Virologist Angela Rasmussen wrote that this is unlikely, due to the intense scrutiny and government oversight gain of function research is subject to, and it is improbable that research on hard-to-obtain coronaviruses could occur under the radar.[52] US National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said misinformation about funding by the US for gain of function research performed in China was being spread, including by US senator Rand Paul.[53] Whether or not the research can be correctly described as gain of function research is disputed.[54]
Another theory suggests the virus arose in humans from an accidental infection of laboratory workers by a natural sample.[55] Misinformation and confusion about the weight of evidence and likelihood of this scenario has been widespread.[27]
In March 2021, an investigatory report released by the WHO described this scenario as ""extremely unlikely"" and not supported by any available evidence.[56] The report acknowledged, however, that the possibility cannot be ruled out without further evidence.[55] The investigation behind this report operated as a joint collaboration between Chinese and international scientists.[57][58] At the release briefing for the report, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated the report's calls for a deeper probe into all evaluated possibilities, including the laboratory origin scenario.[59] The study and report were criticised by heads of state from the USA, the EU, and other WHO member countries for a lack of transparency and incomplete access to data.[60][61][62] Further investigations have also been requested by some scientists, including Anthony Fauci and signatories of a letter published in Science.[63]
Since May 2021, some media organizations softened previous language that described the laboratory leak theory as ""debunked"" or a ""conspiracy theory.""[64] On the other hand, scientific opinion that an accidental leak is possible, but unlikely, has remained steady.[65][66] A number of journalists and scientists have said that they dismissed or avoided discussing the lab leak theory during the first year of the pandemic as a result of perceived polarization resulting from Donald Trump's embrace of the theory.[64][34][67][68]
Some social media users have alleged that the coronavirus was stolen from a Canadian virus research lab by Chinese scientists. Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada said that this had ""no factual basis.""[69] The stories seem to have been derived from a July 2019 CBC news article stating that some Chinese researchers had their security access to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, a Level 4 virology lab, revoked after a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation.[70][71] Canadian officials described this as an administrative matter and said there was no risk to the Canadian public.[70]
Responding to the conspiracy theories, the CBC stated that its articles ""never claimed the two scientists were spies, or that they brought any version of the coronavirus to the lab in Wuhan."" While pathogen samples were transferred from the lab in Winnipeg to Beijing on 31 March 2019, neither of the samples contained a coronavirus, the Public Health Agency of Canada has stated that the shipment conformed to all federal policies, and that that the researchers in question are still under investigation, and thus it cannot be confirmed nor denied that these two were responsible for sending the shipment. The current location of the researchers under investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has also not been released.[69][72][73]
In a January 2020 press conference, NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, when asked about the case, stated that he could not comment specifically on it, but expressed concerns about ""increased efforts by the nations to spy on NATO allies in different ways.""[74]
Politicians from several different countries have asserted that scientists in the United States created SARS-COV-2 in a laboratory (often USAMRIID at Fort Detrick is implicated directly). In these misinformation narratives, the U.S. spread the virus to weaken other countries perceived as enemies (namely China, Iran, or Russia). The fact that the U.S. has had one of the worst COVID-19 pandemic outcomes of any country (per capita) is cited as an unintended side effect of an intentional act of war.
According to London-based The Economist, plenty of conspiracy theories exist on China's internet about COVID-19 being the CIA's creation to keep China down.[75] According to an investigation by ProPublica, such conspiracy theories and disinformation have been propagated under the direction of China News Service, the country's second largest government-owned media outlet controlled by the United Front Work Department.[76] Global Times and Xinhua News Agency have similarly been implicated in propagating disinformation related to COVID-19's origins.[77] NBC News however has noted that there have also been debunking efforts of US-related conspiracy theories posted online, with a WeChat search of ""Coronavirus is from the U.S."" reported to mostly yield articles explaining why such claims are unreasonable.[78][a]
On 12 March 2020, two spokesmen for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhao Lijian and Geng Shuang, alleged at a press conference that Western powers may have ""bio-engineered"" the coronavirus, alluding to the US Government, but more specifically to the US Army as having created and spread the virus.[91]
In January 2021, Hua Chunying renewed the conspiracy theory from Lijian and Shuang that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originating in the United States at the U.S. biological weapons lab Fort Detrick. This conspiracy theory quickly went trending on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, and Chunying continued to cite evidence on Twitter, while asking the government of the United States to open up Fort Detrick for further investigation to determine if it is the source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.[92][93]
On 22 February 2020, US officials alleged that Russia is behind an ongoing disinformation campaign, using thousands of social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to deliberately promote unfounded conspiracy theories, claiming the virus is a biological weapon manufactured by the CIA and the US is waging economic war on China using the virus.[94][95][96][b]
According to Washington, DC-based nonprofit Middle East Media Research Institute, numerous writers in the Arabic press have promoted the conspiracy theory that COVID-19, as well as SARS and the swine flu virus, were deliberately created and spread to sell vaccines against these diseases, and it is ""part of an economic and psychological war waged by the U.S. against China with the aim of weakening it and presenting it as a backward country and a source of diseases.""[102][c]
The same theory has been reported via Iranian propaganda ""to damage its culture and honor.""[103] Reza Malekzadeh, Iran's deputy health minister and former Minister of Health, rejected claims that the virus was a biological weapon, pointing out that the US would be suffering heavily from it. He said Iran was hard-hit because its close ties to China and reluctance to cut air ties introduced the virus, and because early cases had been mistaken for influenza.[104][d]
The theory has also circulated in the Philippines[e] and Venezuela.[f]
Iran's Press TV asserted that ""Zionist elements developed a deadlier strain of coronavirus against Iran.""[117] Similarly, some Arab media outlets accused Israel and the United States of creating and spreading COVID-19, avian flu, and SARS.[118] Users on social media offered other theories, including the allegation that Jews had manufactured COVID-19 to precipitate a global stock market collapse and thereby profit via insider trading,[119] while a guest on Turkish television posited a more ambitious scenario in which Jews and Zionists had created COVID-19, avian flu, and Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever to ""design the world, seize countries, [and] neuter the world's population.""[120]
Israeli attempts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine prompted negative reactions in Iran. Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi denied initial reports that he had ruled that a Zionist-made vaccine would be halal,[121] and one Press TV journalist tweeted that ""I'd rather take my chances with the virus than consume an Israeli vaccine.""[122] A columnist for the Turkish Yeni Akit asserted that such a vaccine could be a ruse to carry out mass sterilization.[123]
An alert by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the possible threat of far-right extremists intentionally spreading the coronavirus mentioned blame being assigned to Jews and Jewish leaders for causing the pandemic and several statewide shutdowns.[124]
In India, Muslims have been blamed for spreading infection following the emergence of cases linked to a Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering.[125] There are reports of vilification of Muslims on social media and attacks on individuals in India.[126] Claims have been made that Muslims are selling food contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 and that a mosque in Patna was sheltering people from Italy and Iran.[127] These claims were shown to be false.[128] In the UK, there are reports of far-right groups blaming Muslims for the pandemic and falsely claiming that mosques remained open after the national ban on large gatherings.[129]
According to the BBC, Jordan Sather, a YouTuber supporting the QAnon conspiracy theory and the anti-vax movement, has falsely claimed that the outbreak was a population-control scheme created by the Pirbright Institute in England and by former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates.[7][130][131]
Piers Corbyn was described as ""dangerous"" by physician and broadcaster Hilary Jones during their joint interview on Good Morning Britain in early September 2020. Corbyn described the coronavirus as a ""psychological operation to close down the economy in the interests of mega-corporations"" and stated ""vaccines cause death.""[132]
In February 2020, BBC News reported that conspiracy theorists on social media groups alleged a link between coronavirus and 5G mobile networks, claiming that the Wuhan and Diamond Princess outbreaks were directly caused by electromagnetic fields and by the introduction of 5G and wireless technologies. Conspiracy theorists have alleged that the pandemic was a cover-up for a 5G-related illness.[133]
In March 2020, Thomas Cowan, a holistic medical practitioner who trained as a physician and operates on probation with the Medical Board of California, alleged that COVID-19 is caused by 5G. He based this on the claims that African countries had not been affected significantly by the pandemic and Africa was not a 5G region.[134][135] Cowan also falsely alleged that the viruses were waste from cells that were poisoned by electromagnetic fields, and that historical viral pandemics coincided with major developments in radio technology.[135]
The video of Cowan's claims went viral and was recirculated by celebrities, including Woody Harrelson, John Cusack, and singer Keri Hilson.[136] The claims may also have been recirculated by an alleged ""coordinated disinformation campaign"", similar to campaigns used by the Internet Research Agency in Saint Petersburg, Russia.[137] The claims were criticized on social media and debunked by Reuters,[138] USA Today,[139] Full Fact[140] and American Public Health Association executive director Georges C. Benjamin.[134][141]
Cowan's claims were repeated by Mark Steele, a conspiracy theorist who claimed to have first-hand knowledge that 5G was in fact a weapon system capable of causing symptoms identical to those produced by the virus.[142] Kate Shemirani, a former nurse who had been struck off the UK nursing registry and had become a promoter of conspiracy theories, repeatedly claimed that these symptoms were identical to those produced by exposure to electromagnetic fields.[143][144]
Steve Powis, national medical director of NHS England, described theories linking 5G mobile phone networks to COVID-19 as the ""worst kind of fake news.""[145] Viruses cannot be transmitted by radio waves, and COVID-19 has spread and continues to spread in many countries that do not have 5G networks.[146]
There were 20 suspected arson attacks on phone masts in the UK over the 2020 Easter weekend.[145] These included an incident in Dagenham where three men were arrested on suspicion of arson, a fire in Huddersfield that affected a mast used by emergency services, and a fire in a mast that provides mobile connectivity to the NHS Nightingale Hospital Birmingham.[145] Some telecom engineers reported threats of violence, including threats to stab and murder them, by individuals who believe them to be working on 5G networks.[147] On 12 April 2020, Gardaí and fire services were called to fires at 5G masts in County Donegal, Ireland.[148] The Gardaí were treating the fires as arson.[148] After the arson attacks, British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the theory that COVID-19 virus may be spread by 5G wireless communication is ""just nonsense, dangerous nonsense as well.""[149] Telecommunications provider Vodafone announced that two Vodafone masts and two it shares with O2, another provider, had been targeted.[150][151]
By 6 April 2020, at least 20 mobile phone masts in the UK had been vandalised since the previous Thursday.[152] Because of the slow rollout of 5G in the UK, many of the damaged masts had only 3G and 4G equipment.[152] Mobile phone and home broadband operators estimated there were at least 30 incidents where engineers maintaining equipment were confronted in the week up to 6 April.[152] As of 30 May, there had been 29 incidents of attempted arson at mobile phone masts in the Netherlands, including one case where ""Fuck 5G"" was written.[153][154] There have also been incidents in Ireland and Cyprus.[155] Facebook has deleted messages encouraging attacks on 5G equipment.[152]
Engineers working for Openreach, a division of British Telecom, posted pleas on anti-5G Facebook groups asking to be spared abuse as they are not involved with maintaining mobile networks.[156] Industry lobby group Mobile UK said the incidents were affecting the maintenance of networks that support home working and provide critical connections to vulnerable customers, emergency services, and hospitals.[156] A widely circulated video showed a woman accusing employees of broadband company Community Fibre of installing 5G as part of a plan to kill the population.[156]
Of those who believed that 5G networks caused COVID-19 symptoms, 60% stated that much of their knowledge about the virus came from YouTube.[157] In April 2020, YouTube announced that it would reduce the amount of content claiming links between 5G and coronavirus.[150] Videos that are conspiratorial about 5G that do not mention coronavirus would not be removed, though they might be considered ""borderline content"" and therefore removed from search recommendations, losing advertising revenue.[150] The discredited claims had been circulated by British conspiracy theorist David Icke in videos (subsequently removed) on YouTube and Vimeo, and an interview by London Live TV network, prompting calls for action by Ofcom.[158][159] It took YouTube on average 41 days to remove Covid-related videos containing false information in the first half of 2020.[160]
Ofcom issued guidance to ITV following comments by Eamonn Holmes about 5G and coronavirus on This Morning.[161] Ofcom said the comments were ""ambiguous"" and ""ill-judged"" and they ""risked undermining viewers' trust in advice from public authorities and scientific evidence.""[161] Ofcom also found local channel London Live in breach of standards for an interview it had with David Icke. It said that he had ""expressed views which had the potential to cause significant harm to viewers in London during the pandemic.""[161]
On 24 April 2020, The Guardian revealed that Jonathan Jones, an evangelical pastor from Luton, had provided the male voice on a recording blaming 5G for deaths caused by coronavirus.[162] He claimed to have formerly headed the largest business unit at Vodafone, but insiders at the company said that he was hired for a sales position in 2014 when 5G was not a priority for the company and that 5G would not have been part of his job.[162] He had left Vodafone after less than a year.[162]
A tweet started an internet meme that Bank of England £20 banknotes contained a picture of a 5G mast and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Facebook and YouTube removed items pushing this story, and fact checking organisations established that the picture is of Margate Lighthouse and the ""virus"" is the staircase at the Tate Britain.[163][164][165]
In April 2020, rumors circulated on Facebook, alleging that the US Government had ""just discovered and arrested"" Dr. Charles Lieber, chair of the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department at Harvard University for ""manufacturing and selling"" the novel coronavirus to China. According to a report from Reuters, posts spreading the rumor were shared in multiple languages over 79,000 times on Facebook.[166] Lieber was arrested on 28 January 2020, and later charged with two federal counts of making an allegedly false statement about his links to a Chinese university, unrelated to the virus. The rumor of Lieber, a chemist in an area entirely unrelated to the virus research, creating the coronavirus and selling it to China has been discredited.[167]
In 2020, a group of researchers that most notably included Edward J. Steele and Chandra Wickramasinghe, claimed in ten research papers that COVID-19 originated from a meteor spotted as a bright fireball over the city of Songyuan in Northeast China on 11 October 2019 and that a fragment of the meteor landed in the Wuhan area, which started the first COVID-19 outbreaks. However, the group of researchers did not provide any direct evidence proving this theory.[168]
In an August 2020 article, Astronomy.com called the meteor origin theory ""so remarkable that it makes the others look boring by comparison.""[168]
A claim that the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health confirmed that polymerase chain reaction testing is fake became popular in the Philippines and remains a widespread belief. According to a report from AFP, research associate Joshua Miguel Danac of the University of the Philippines’ National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology debunked the claim, calling PCR tests ""the gold standard for diagnosis.""[169] Fake testing and perception of fake testing remains a problem in the Philipppines.[170]
Correctly reporting the number of people who were sick or who had died was a struggle, especially during the earliest days of the pandemic. In the US, the public health handling of the pandemic has been hampered by the use of archaic technology (including FAX machines and incompatible formats),[171] poor data flow and management (or even no access to data), and general lack of standardization and leadership.[172] Privacy laws hampered contact tracing and case finding efforts, which resulted in under-diagnosis and under-reporting.[173]
Accusations have been made of under-reporting, over-reporting, and other problems. Necessary data was corrupted in some places, for example, on the state level in the United States.[174]
Leaked documents show that China's public reporting of cases gave an incomplete picture during the early stages of the pandemic. For example, on 10 February 2020, China publicly reported 2,478 new confirmed cases. However, confidential internal documents that later leaked to CNN showed 5,918 new cases on 10 February. These were broken down as 2,345 confirmed cases[clarification needed], 1,772 clinically diagnosed cases and 1,796 suspected cases.[175][176]
In August 2020, President Donald Trump retweeted a conspiracy theory alleging that COVID-19 deaths are systematically overcounted, and that only 6% of the reported deaths in the United States were actually from the disease.[177] This 6% number is based on only counting death certificates where COVID-19 is the sole condition listed. The lead mortality statistician at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics said that those death certificates likely did not include all the steps that led to the death and thus were incomplete. The CDC collects data based on case surveillance, vital records, and excess deaths.[178] A FactCheck.org article on the issue reported that while 6% of the death certificates included COVID-19 exclusively as the cause of death and 94% had additional conditions that contributed to it, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause of death in 92% of them, as it may directly cause other severe conditions such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.[179] In mid-October 2020, the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States was reported at 218,511 (CDC), 219,681 (Johns Hopkins University) and 219,541 (The New York Times).
On 5 February 2020, Taiwan News published an article claiming that Tencent may have accidentally leaked the real numbers of death and infection in China. Taiwan News suggested that the Tencent Epidemic Situation Tracker had briefly showed infected cases and death tolls many times higher of the official figure, citing a Facebook post by 38-year-old Taiwanese beverage store owner Hiroki Lo and an anonymous Taiwanese netizen.[180][181] The article, referenced by other news outlets such as the Daily Mail and widely circulated on Twitter, Facebook and 4chan, sparked a wide range of conspiracy theories that the screenshot indicates the real death toll instead of the ones published by health officials.[182] Justin Lessler, associate professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, claims the numbers of the alleged ""leak"" are unreasonable and unrealistic, citing the case fatality rate as far lower than the 'leaked information'. A spokesman for Tencent responded to the news article, claiming the image was doctored, and it features ""false information which we never published.""[183]
The author of the original news article defended the authenticity and newsworthiness of the leak on a WION program.[182]
On 8 February 2020, a report emerged on Twitter claiming that ""data"" showed a massive increase in sulfur emissions over Wuhan, China. The Twitter thread then claimed the reason was due to the mass cremation of coronavirus victims. The story was shared on multiple media outlets, including Daily Express, Daily Mail, and Taiwan News.[184][182] Snopes debunked the misinformation, pointing out that the maps used by the claims were not real-time observations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations above Wuhan. Instead, the data was a computer-generated model based on historical information and forecast on SO2 emissions.[185]
A story in The Epoch Times on 17 February 2020 shared a map from the Internet that falsely alleged massive sulfur dioxide releases from crematoriums during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, speculating that 14,000 bodies may have been burned.[186] A fact check by AFP reported that the map was a NASA forecast taken out of context.[186]
On 26 February 2020, the Taiwanese Central News Agency reported that large amounts of misinformation had appeared on Facebook claiming the pandemic in Taiwan was out of control, the Taiwanese government had covered up the total number of cases, and that President Tsai Ing-wen had been infected. The Taiwan fact-checking organization had suggested the misinformation on Facebook shared similarities with mainland China due to its use of simplified Chinese characters and mainland China vocabulary. The organization warned that the purpose of the misinformation is to attack the government.[187][188][189]
In March 2020, Taiwan's Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau warned that China was trying to undermine trust in factual news by portraying the Taiwanese government reports as fake news. Taiwanese authorities have been ordered to use all possible means to track whether the messages were linked to instructions given by the Chinese Communist Party. The PRC's Taiwan Affairs Office denied the claims, calling them lies, and said that Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party was ""inciting hatred"" between the two sides. They then claimed that the ""DPP continues to politically manipulate the virus.""[190] According to The Washington Post, China has used organized disinformation campaigns against Taiwan for decades.[191]
Nick Monaco, the research director of the Digital Intelligence Lab at Institute for the Future, analyzed the posts and concluded that the majority appear to have come from ordinary users in China, not the state. However, he criticized the Chinese government's decision to allow the information to spread beyond China's Great Firewall, which he described as ""malicious.""[192] According to Taiwan News, nearly one in four cases of misinformation are believed to be connected to China.[193]
On 27 March 2020, the American Institute in Taiwan announced that it was partnering with the Taiwan FactCheck Center to help combat misinformation about the COVID-19 outbreak.[194]
In early February 2020, a decade-old map illustrating a hypothetical viral outbreak published by the World Population Project (part of the University of Southampton) was misappropriated by a number of Australian media news outlets (and British tabloids The Sun, Daily Mail and Metro)[195] which claimed the map represented the COVID-19 pandemic. This misinformation was then spread via the social media accounts of the same media outlets, and while some outlets later removed the map, the BBC reported, on 19 February, that a number of news sites had yet to retract the map.[195]
On 24 January 2020, a video circulated online appearing to be of a nurse named Jin Hui[196] in Hubei, describing a far more dire situation in Wuhan than reported by Chinese officials. The video claimed that more than 90,000 people had been infected with the virus in China, that the virus could spread from one person to 14 people (R0=14) and that the virus was starting a second mutation.[197] The video attracted millions of views on various social media platforms and was mentioned in numerous online reports. However, the BBC said that, contrary to its English subtitles in one of the video's existing versions, the woman does not claim to be either a nurse or a doctor in the video and that her suit and mask do not match the ones worn by medical staff in Hubei.[7] The claimed R0 of 14 in the video was noted by the BBC to be inconsistent with the expert estimation of 1.4 to 2.5 at that time.[198] The video's claim of 90,000 infected cases was noted to be 'unsubstantiated'.[7][197]
There was a decrease of nearly 21 million cellphone subscriptions among the three largest cellphone carriers in China, which led to misinformation that this is evidence for millions of deaths due to the coronavirus in China.[199] The drop is attributed to cancellations of phone services due to a downturn in the social and economic life during the outbreak.[199]
COVID-19 deniers use the word casedemic as a shorthand for a conspiracy theory holding that COVID-19 is harmless and that the reported disease figures are merely a result of increased testing. The concept is particularly attractive to anti-vaccination activists, who use it to argue that public health measures, and particularly vaccines, are not needed to counter what they say is a fake epidemic.[200][201][202][203]
David Gorski writes that the word casedemic was seemingly coined by Ivor Cummins—an engineer whose views are popular among COVID-19 deniers—in August 2020.[200]
The term has been adopted by alternative medicine advocate Joseph Mercola, who has exaggerated the effect of false positives in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to construct a false narrative that testing is invalid because it is not perfectly accurate. In reality, the problems with PCR testing are well-known and accounted for by public health authorities. Such claims also disregard the possibility of asymptomatic spread, the number of potentially-undetected cases during the initial phases of the pandemic in comparison to the present due to increased testing and knowledge since, and other variables that can influence PCR tests.[200]
Early in the pandemic, little information was known about how the virus spreads, when the first people became sick, or who was most vulnerable to infection, serious complications, or death. During 2020, it became clear that the main route of spread was through exposure to the virus-laden respiratory droplets produced by an infected person.[204] There were also some early questions about whether the disease might have been present earlier than reported; however, subsequent research disproved this idea.[205][206]
On 31 March 2020, Victor Davis Hanson publicized a theory that COVID-19 May have been in California in the fall of 2019 resulting in a level of herd immunity to at least partially explain differences in infection rates in cities such as New York City vs Los Angeles.[207] Jeff Smith of Santa Clara County stated that evidence indicated the virus may have been in California since December 2019.[208] Early genetic and antibody analyses refute the idea that the virus was in the United States prior to January 2020.[205][206][209][210][needs update]
In March, conspiracy theorists started the false rumor that Maatje Benassi, a US army reservist, was ""Patient Zero"" of the pandemic, the first person to be infected with COVID-19.[211] Benassi was targeted because of her participation in the 2019 Military World Games at Wuhan before the pandemic started, even though she never tested positive for the virus. Conspiracy theorists even connected her family to the DJ Benny Benassi as a Benassi virus plot, even though they are not related and Benny had also not had the virus.[212]
Early in the pandemic it was claimed that COVID-19 could be spread by contact with contaminated surfaces or fomites—even though this is an uncommon transmission route for other respiratory viruses. This led to recommendations that high-contact surfaces (like playground equipment or school desks) be frequently deep-cleaned and that certain items (like groceries or mailed packages) be disinfected.[213] Ultimately, the US CDC concluded that the likelihood of transmission under these scenarios was less than 1 in 10,000.[214] They further concluded that handwashing reduced the risk of exposure to COVID-19, but surface disinfection did not.[214]
There have been claims that specific ethnicities are more or less vulnerable to COVID-19. COVID-19 is a new zoonotic disease, so no population has yet had the time to develop population immunity.[medical citation needed]
Beginning on 11 February, reports, quickly spread via Facebook, implied that a Cameroonian student in China had been completely cured of the virus due to his African genetics. While a student was successfully treated, other media sources have indicated that no evidence implies Africans are more resistant to the virus and labeled such claims as false information.[215] Kenyan Secretary of Health Mutahi Kagwe explicitly refuted rumors that ""those with black skin cannot get coronavirus"", while announcing Kenya's first case on 13 March.[216] This myth was cited as a contributing factor in the disproportionately high rates of infection and death observed among African Americans.[217][218]
There have been claims of ""Indian immunity"": that the people of India have more immunity to the COVID-19 virus due to living conditions in India. This idea was deemed ""absolute drivel"" by Anand Krishnan, professor at the Centre for Community Medicine of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). He said there was no population immunity to the COVID-19 virus yet, as it is new, and it is not even clear whether people who have recovered from COVID-19 will have lasting immunity, as this happens with some viruses but not with others.[219]
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed the virus was genetically targeted at Iranians by the US, giving this explanation for the pandemic having seriously affected Iran. He did not offer any evidence.[220][221]
A group of Jordanian researchers published a report claiming that Arabs are less vulnerable to COVID-19 due to a genetic variation specific to those of Middle East heritage. This paper had not been debunked by November 2020.[222]
COVID-19-related xenophobic attacks have been made against individuals with the attacker blaming the victim for COVID-19 on the basis of the victim's ethnicity. People who are considered to look Chinese have been subjected to COVID-19-related verbal and physical attacks in many other countries, often by people accusing them of transmitting the virus.[223][224][225] Within China, there has been discrimination (such as evictions and refusal of service in shops) against people from anywhere closer to Wuhan (where the pandemic started) and against anyone perceived as being non-Chinese (especially those considered African), as the Chinese government has blamed continuing cases on re-introductions of the virus from abroad (90% of reintroduced cases were by Chinese passport-holders). Neighbouring countries have also discriminated against people seen as Westerners.[226][227][228]
People have also simply blamed other local groups along the lines of pre-existing social tensions and divisions, sometimes citing reporting of COVID-19 cases within that group. For instance, Muslims have been widely blamed, shunned, and discriminated against in India (including some violent attacks), amid unfounded claims that Muslims are deliberately spreading COVID-19, and a Muslim event at which the disease did spread has received far more public attention than many similar events run by other groups and the government.[229] White supremacist groups have blamed COVID-19 on non-whites and advocated deliberately infecting minorities they dislike, such as Jews.[230]
Some media outlets, including Daily Mail and RT, as well as individuals, disseminated a video showing a Chinese woman eating a bat, falsely suggesting it was filmed in Wuhan and connecting it to the outbreak.[231][232] However, the widely circulated video contains unrelated footage of a Chinese travel vlogger, Wang Mengyun, eating bat soup in the island country of Palau in 2016.[231][232][233][234] Wang posted an apology on Weibo,[233][234] in which she said she had been abused and threatened,[233] and that she had only wanted to showcase Palauan cuisine.[233][234] The spread of misinformation about bat consumption has been characterized by xenophobic and racist sentiment toward Asians.[235][236][237] In contrast, scientists suggest the virus originated in bats and migrated into an intermediary host animal before infecting people.[235][238]
South Korean ""conservative populist"" Jun Kwang-hun told his followers there was no risk to mass public gatherings as the virus was impossible to contract outdoors. Many of his followers are elderly.[239]
Misinformation has spread that the lifetime of SARS-CoV-2 is only 12 hours and that staying home for 14 hours during the Janata curfew would break the chain of transmission.[240] Another message claimed that observing the Janata curfew would result in the reduction of COVID-19 cases by 40%.[240]
It has been claimed that mosquitoes transmit coronavirus. There is no evidence that this is true. Coronavirus is likely to spread through small droplets of saliva and mucus.[146]
A fake Costco product recall notice circulated on social media purporting that Kirkland-brand bath tissue had been contaminated with COVID-19 (meaning SARS-CoV-2) due to the item being made in China. No evidence supports that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on surfaces for prolonged periods of time (as might happen during shipping), and Costco has not issued such a recall.[241][242][243]
A warning claiming to be from the Australia Department of Health said coronavirus spreads through petrol pumps and that everyone should wear gloves when filling up petrol in their cars.[244]
There were claims that wearing shoes at one's home was the reason behind the spread of the coronavirus in Italy.[245]
In March 2020, the Miami New Times reported that managers at Norwegian Cruise Line had prepared a set of responses intended to convince wary customers to book cruises, including ""blatantly false"" claims that the coronavirus ""can only survive in cold temperatures, so the Caribbean is a fantastic choice for your next cruise"", that ""[s]cientists and medical professionals have confirmed that the warm weather of the spring will be the end of the [c]oronavirus"", and that the virus ""cannot live in the amazingly warm and tropical temperatures that your cruise will be sailing to.""[246]
Flu is seasonal (becoming less frequent in the summer) in some countries, but not in others. While it is possible that the COVID-19 coronavirus will also show some seasonality, it is not yet known.[247][248][249][medical citation needed] When the COVID-19 coronavirus spread along international air travel routes, it does not bypass tropical locations.[250] Outbreaks on cruise ships, where an older population lives in close quarters, frequently touching surfaces which others have touched, were common.[251][252]
It seems that COVID-19 can be transmitted in all climates.[146] It has seriously affected many warm-climate countries. For instance, Dubai, with a year-round average daily high of 28.0 Celsius (82.3 °F) and the airport said to have the world's most international traffic, has had thousands of cases.[medical citation needed]
While commercial companies that make breastmilk substitutes promote their products during the pandemic, the WHO and UNICEF advise that women should continue to breastfeed during the COVID-19 pandemic even if they have confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Current evidence indicates that it is unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through breast milk.[253]
People tried many different things to prevent infection. Sometimes the misinformation was false claims of efficacy, such as claims that the virus could not spread during religious ceremonies, and other times, and other times, the misinformation was false claims of inefficacy, such as claiming that alcohol-based hand sanitizer did not work. In other cases, especially with regard to public health advice about wearing face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, additional scientific evidence resulted in different advice over time.[254]
Claims that hand sanitizer is merely ""antibacterial not antiviral"", and therefore ineffective against COVID-19, have spread widely on Twitter and other social networks. While the effectiveness of sanitiser depends on the specific ingredients, most hand sanitiser sold commercially inactivates SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.[256][257] Hand sanitizer is recommended against COVID-19,[146] though unlike soap, it is not effective against all types of germs.[258] Washing in soap and water for at least 20 seconds is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as the best way to clean hands in most situations. However, if soap and water are not available, a hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol can be used instead, unless hands are visibly dirty or greasy.[255][259] The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration both recommend plain soap; there is no evidence that antibacterial soaps are any better, and limited evidence that they might be worse long-term.[260][261]
Authorities, especially in Asia, recommended wearing face masks in public early in the pandemic. In other parts of the world, authorities made conflicting (or contradictory) statements.[263] Several governments and institutions, such as in the United States, initially dismissed the use of face masks by the general population, often with misleading or incomplete information about their effectiveness.[264][265][266] Commentators have attributed the anti-mask messaging to attempts at managing mask shortages caused by initial inaction, remarking that the claims went beyond the science, or were simply lies.[266][267][268][269]
In February 2020, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted ""Seriously people—STOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus""; he later reversed his position with evidence mounting that masks can limit the spread of coronavirus.[270][271] On 12 June 2020, Anthony Fauci (a key member of the White House coronavirus task force) confirmed that the American public were told not to wear masks from the beginning, due to a shortage of masks, and then explained that masks do actually work.[272][273][274][275]
Some media outlets claimed that neck gaiters were worse than not wearing masks at all in the COVID-19 pandemic, misinterpreting a study which was intended to demonstrate a method for evaluating masks (and not actually to determine the effectiveness of different types of masks).[276][277][278] The study also only looked at one wearer wearing the one neck gaiter made from a polyester/spandex blend, which is not sufficient evidence to support the claim about gaiters made in the media.[277] The study found that the neck gaiter, which was made from a thin and stretchy material, appeared to be ineffective at limiting airborne droplets expelled from the wearer; Isaac Henrion, one of the co-authors, suggests that the result was likely due to the material rather than the style, stating that ""Any mask made from that fabric would probably have the same result, no matter the design.""[279] Warren S. Warren, a co-author, said that they tried to be careful with their language in interviews, but added that the press coverage has ""careened out of control"" for a study testing a measuring technique.[276]
There are false claims spread that the usage of masks causes adverse health-related issues such as low blood oxygen levels,[280] high blood carbon dioxide levels,[281] and a weakened immune system.[282] Some also falsely claimed that masks cause antibiotic-resistant pneumonia by preventing pathogenic organisms to be exhaled away from the body.[283]
Individuals have speciously claimed legal or medical exemptions to avoid complying with mask mandates.[284] Individuals have, for instance, claimed that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA; designed to prohibit discrimination based on disabilities) allows exemption from mask requirements. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) responded that the Act ""does not provide a blanket exemption to people with disabilities from complying with legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operations.""[285] The DOJ also issued a warning about cards (sometimes featuring DOJ logos or ADA notices) that claim to ""exempt"" their holders from wearing masks, stating that these cards are fraudulent and not issued by any government agency.[286][287]
On 31 July 2020, Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte said those who did not have cleaning supplies could use gasoline as a disinfectant to clean their masks:[288] ""For people who don't [have Lysol], drench it in gasoline or diesel... just find some gasoline [and] dip your hand [with the mask] in it.""[288] His spokesman, Harry Roque, later corrected him.[288]
Contrary to some reports, drinking alcohol does not protect against COVID-19, and can increase health risks[146] (short term and long term). Drinking alcohol is ethanol; other alcohols, such as methanol, which causes methanol poisoning, are acutely poisonous, and may be present in badly prepared alcoholic beverages.[289]
Iran has reported incidents of methanol poisoning, caused by the false belief that drinking alcohol would cure or protect against coronavirus;[290] alcohol is banned in Iran, and bootleg alcohol may contain methanol.[291] According to Iranian media in March 2020, nearly 300 people have died and more than a thousand have become ill due to methanol poisoning, while Associated Press gave figures of around 480 deaths with 2,850 others affected.[292] The number of deaths due to methanol poisoning in Iran reached over 700 by April.[293] Iranian social media had circulated a story from British tabloids that a British man and others had been cured of coronavirus with whiskey and honey,[290][294] which combined with the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers as disinfectants, led to the false belief that drinking high-proof alcohol can kill the virus.[290][291][292]
Similar incidents have occurred in Turkey, with 30 Turkmenistan citizens dying from methanol poisoning related to coronavirus cure claims.[295][296]
In Kenya, in April 2020, the Governor of Nairobi Mike Sonko came under scrutiny for including small bottles of the cognac Hennessy in care packages, falsely claiming that alcohol serves as ""throat sanitizer"" and that, from research, it is believed that ""alcohol plays a major role in killing the coronavirus.""[297][298]
There were several claims that drinking warm drinks from around 30 °C protects you from COVID-19, most notably by Alberto Fernández, the president of Argentina said ""The WHO recommends that one drink many hot drinks because heat kills the virus."" Scientists commented that the WHO had made no such recommendation, and that drinking hot water can damage the oral mucosa.[299]
These false claims mostly spread out across social media and in Latin American countries.
Claims that vegetarians are immune to coronavirus spread online in India, causing ""#NoMeat_NoCoronaVirus"" to trend on Twitter.[300][301] Eating meat does not have an effect on COVID-19 spread, according to Dr. Anand Krishnan of AIIMS.[302] Fisheries, Dairying and Animal Husbandry Minister Giriraj Singh said the rumour had significantly affected industry, with the price of a chicken falling to a third of pre-pandemic levels. He also described efforts to improve the hygiene of the meat supply chain.[303]
A number of religious groups have claimed protection due to their faith, some refusing to stop large religious gatherings. In Israel, some Ultra-Orthodox Jews initially refused to close synagogues and religious seminaries and disregarded government restrictions because ""The Torah protects and saves"",[304] which resulted in an eight-fold faster rate of infection among some groups.[305] The Islamic missionary movement Tablighi Jamaat organised Ijtema mass gatherings in Malaysia, India, and Pakistan whose participants believed that God will protect them, causing the biggest rise in COVID-19 cases in these and other countries.[306][307][308] In Iran, the head of Fatima Masumeh Shrine encouraged pilgrims to visit the shrine despite calls to close the shrine, saying that they ""consider this holy shrine to be a place of healing.""[309] In South Korea the River of Grace Community Church in Gyeonggi Province spread the virus after spraying salt water into their members' mouths in the belief that it would kill the virus,[310] while the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu where a church leader claimed that no Shincheonji worshipers had caught the virus in February while hundreds died in Wuhan, later caused in the biggest spread of the virus in the country.[311][312]
In Tanzania, President John Magufuli, instead of banning congregations, urged the faithfuls to go to pray in churches and mosques in the belief that it will protect them. He said that the coronavirus is a devil, therefore ""cannot survive in the body of Jesus Christ, it will burn"" (the ""body of Jesus Christ"" refers to the church).[313][314]
In Somalia, myths have spread claiming Muslims are immune to the virus.[315]
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, on 9 March 2020, the Church of Greece announced that Holy Communion, in which churchgoers eat pieces of bread soaked in wine from the same chalice, would continue as a practice.[316] The Holy Synod said Holy Communion ""cannot be the cause of the spread of illness"", with Metropolitan Seraphim saying the wine was without blemish because it represented the blood and body of Christ, and that ""whoever attends Holy Communion is approaching God, who has the power to heal.""[316] The Church refused to restrict Christians from taking Holy Communion,[317] which was supported by several clerics,[318] some politicians, and health professionals.[318][319] The Greek Association of Hospital Doctors criticized these professionals for putting their religious beliefs before science.[318] A review of the medical publications on the subject, published by a Greek physician, claims that the transmission of any infectious disease through the Holy Communion has never been documented. This controversy divided the Greek society, the politics and medical experts.[320]
In 2020, small observational studies were discussed on social media and other outlets in which tobacco smoking was shown to be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infections. In April 2020, researchers at a Paris hospital noted an inverse relationship between smoking and Covid-19 infections, which led to an increase in tobacco sales in France. The results were so astonishing first that the French government initiated a clinical trial with transdermal nicotine patches. Clinical reviews of available information are clear, however, smoking leads to an increased chance of Covid-19 infections, and smokers generally experience much more severe respiratory symptoms.[321][322]
Cocaine does not protect against COVID-19. Several viral tweets purporting that snorting cocaine would sterilize one's nostrils of the coronavirus spread around Europe and Africa. In response, the French Ministry of Health released a public service announcement debunking this claim, saying ""No, cocaine does NOT protect against COVID-19. It is an addictive drug that causes serious side effects and is harmful to people's health."" The World Health Organization also debunked the claim.[323]
In Sri Lanka, the Philippines and India, it has been claimed that one should stay at home on particular days when helicopters spray ""COVID–19 disinfectant"" over homes. No such spraying has taken place, nor is it planned, nor, as of July 2020, is there any such agent to be sprayed.[324][325]
The notion that the vibrations generated by clapping together during March 2020 Janata curfew would kill the virus was debunked by the media.[326] Amitabh Bachchan was heavily criticised for one of his tweets, which claimed vibrations from clapping, blowing conch shells as part of the Janata Curfew would have reduced or destroyed coronavirus potency as it was Amavasya, the darkest day of the month.[327]
In India, fake news circulated that the World Health Organization warned against eating cabbage to prevent coronavirus infection.[328] Claims that the poisonous fruit of the Datura plant is a preventive measure for COVID-19 resulted in eleven people being hospitalized in India. They ate the fruit, following the instructions from a TikTok video that propagated misinformation regarding the prevention of COVID-19.[329][330]
Anti-vaccination activists and other people spread a variety of rumors, including overblown claims about side effects, a story about COVID-19 being spread by childhood vaccines, misrepresentations about how the immune system works, and when and how COVID-19 vaccines are made.
The use of mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19 has been the basis of misinformation circulated in social media, wrongly claiming that the use of RNA somehow alters a person's DNA.[331] The DNA alteration conspiracy theory was cited by a Wisconsin hospital pharmacist who deliberately removed 57 vaccine vials from cold storage in December 2020 and was subsequently charged with felony reckless endangerment and criminal damage to property by Ozaukee County prosecutors.[332]
mRNA in the cytosol is very rapidly degraded before it would have time to gain entry into the cell nucleus. (mRNA vaccines must be stored at very low temperature to prevent mRNA degradation.) Retrovirus can be single-stranded RNA (just as SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is single-stranded RNA) which enters the cell nucleus and uses reverse transcriptase to make DNA from the RNA in the cell nucleus. A retrovirus has mechanisms to be imported into the nucleus, but other mRNA lack these mechanisms. Once inside the nucleus, creation of DNA from RNA cannot occur without a primer, which accompanies a retrovirus, but which would not exist for other mRNA if placed in the nucleus.[333][334] Thus, mRNA vaccines cannot alter DNA because they cannot enter the nucleus, and because they have no primer to activate reverse transcriptase.
In a viral blog post, German politician Wolfgang Wodarg, together with ex-Pfizer employee and conspiracy theorist Michael Yeadon, spread misinformation claiming that COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility in women. Commenting on these claims, David Gorski wrote ""The sad thing is that this not-so-dynamic duo is stoking real fear that the new COVID-19 vaccines will make women infertile and is doing it based on speculative nonsense.""[335]
False claims have also been made that a vaccinated person can ""shed"" spike proteins, which allegedly causes menstrual irregularities or other harmful effects on the reproductive health of non-vaccinated women who are in proximity to them. These claims have been cited by the Centner Academy private school in Miami (which removed vaccinated teachers from classrooms, and was refusing to hire vaccinated teachers in the future), and businesses banning customers who are vaccinated. Gynecologist and medical columnist Jen Gunter stated none of the vaccines currently approved in the United States ""can possibly affect a person who has not been vaccinated, and this includes their menstruation, fertility, and pregnancy.""[336][337][338][339][340] In May 2021, Vice reported that some promoters of this claim have, ironically, recommended the use of face masks and social distancing to protect themselves from those who have been vaccinated.[341]
Social media posts in Cameroon pushed a conspiracy theory that polio vaccines contained coronavirus, further complicating polio eradication beyond the logistical and funding difficulties created by the COVID-19 pandemic.[342]
Claims have been circulated on social media that the Pfizer‑BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine (active ingredient tozinameran) causes Bell's palsy. During the trial, four of the 22,000 trial participants had Bell's palsy, the FDA observed that the ""frequency of reported Bell's palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population.""[343]
Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is the phenomenon in which a person with antibodies against one virus (i.e. from infection or vaccination) can develop worse disease when infected by a second closely-related virus, due to a unique and rare reaction with proteins on the surface of the second virus.[344][345] ADE has been observed in animal studies during the development of past coronavirus vaccines, but as of 14 June 2021 there had been no observed incidences in human vaccine trials. ADE has been observed in vitro and in animal studies with many different viruses that do not display ADE in humans.[346][344] Nevertheless, anti-vaccination activists falsely cite ADE as a reason to avoid vaccination against COVID-19.[335][347]
Multiple social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that in the early stages of the pandemic, the virus was known and that a vaccine was already available. PolitiFact and FactCheck.org noted that no vaccine existed for COVID-19 at that point. The patents cited by various social media posts reference existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as the SARS coronavirus.[348][349] The WHO reported that as of 5 February 2020, despite news reports of ""breakthrough drugs"" being discovered, there were no treatments known to be effective;[350] this included antibiotics and herbal remedies not being useful.[351]
On Facebook, a widely shared post claimed in April 2020 that seven Senegalese children had died because they had received a COVID-19 vaccine. No such vaccine existed, although some were in clinical trials at that time.[352]
In November 2020, claims circulated on the web that the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine ""contained"" tissue from aborted fetuses. While it is true that cell lines derived from a fetus aborted in 1970 plays a role in the vaccine development process, the molecules are completely separate from the vaccine itself.[353][354]
A widely reposted 2021 Facebook post claiming that the mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 could cause prion diseases was based on a paper by J. Bart Classen. The paper was published in Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, whose publisher, Scivision Publishers, is included in Beall's list of publishers of predatory journals. Vincent Racaniello, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, described the claim as ""completely wrong.""[355]
Some have falsely asserted COVID-19 vaccines cause people to become magnetized such that metal objects stick to their bodies.[356] Called by Republicans as an expert witness before a June 2021 hearing of the Ohio House Health Committee, anti-vaccine activist Sherri Tenpenny promoted the false claim, adding, ""There’s been people who have long suspected that there’s been some sort of an interface, yet to be defined interface, between what’s being injected in these shots and all of the 5G towers.""[357]
Widely circulated posts on social media have made many unfounded claims of methods against coronavirus. Some of these claims are scams, and some promoted methods are dangerous and unhealthy.[146][358]
Some conservative figures in the United States, such as Richard Epstein,[359] downplayed the scale of the pandemic, saying it has been exaggerated as part of an effort to hurt President Trump. Some people pointed to empty hospital parking lots as evidence that the virus has been exaggerated. Despite the empty parking lots, many hospitals in New York City and other places experienced thousands of COVID-19-related hospitalizations.[360]
Various national and party-held Chinese media heavily advertised an ""overnight research"" report by Wuhan Institute of Virology and Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, on how shuanghuanglian, an herb mixture from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), can effectively inhibit the novel coronavirus. The report led to a purchase craze of shuanghuanglian.[361]
The president of Madagascar Andry Rajoelina launched and promoted in April 2020 a herbal drink based on an artemisia plant as a miracle cure that can treat and prevent COVID-19 despite a lack of medical evidence. The drink has been exported to other African countries.[362][363]
Based on in-vitro studies, extracts of E. purpurea (Echinaforce) showed virucidal activity against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Because the data was experimental and solely derived from cell cultures, antiviral effects in humans have not been elucidated. As a result, regulatory agencies have not recommended the use of Echinacea preparations for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.[364]
During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, vitamin C was the subject of more FDA warning letters than any other quack treatment for COVID-19.[365]
In February 2020, claims that Vitamin D pills could help prevent COVID-19 circulated on social media in Thailand.[366] In May 2020, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, while noting that ""current advice is that the whole population of the UK should take vitamin D supplements to prevent vitamin D deficiency"", found ""no clinical evidence that vitamin D supplements are beneficial in preventing or treating COVID-19.""[367]
A preprint of a journal article from Indonesia purporting to show beneficial effect of vitamin D for COVID-19 received went viral across social media, and was cited several times in in mainstream academic literature, including in a recommendation from NICE. Subsequent investigation, however, found none of the authors seemed to be known of at the hospitals listed as their affiliations, suggesting the paper was entirely fraudulent.[368]
There were also claims that a 30-year-old Indian textbook lists aspirin, antihistamines, and nasal spray as treatments for COVID-19. The textbook actually talks about coronaviruses in general, as a family of viruses.[369]
A rumor circulated on social media posts on Weibo, Facebook and Twitter claiming that Chinese experts said saline solutions could kill COVID-19. There is no evidence that saline solutions have such an effect.[370]
A tweet from French health minister Olivier Véran, a bulletin from the French health ministry, and a small speculative study in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine raised concerns about ibuprofen worsening COVID-19, which spread extensively on social media. The European Medicines Agency[371] and the World Health Organization recommended COVID-19 patients keep taking ibuprofen as directed, citing lack of convincing evidence of any danger.[372]
Indian political activist Swami Chakrapani and Member of the Legislative Assembly Suman Haripriya claimed that drinking cow urine and applying cow dung on the body can cure COVID-19.[373][374] In Manipur, two people were arrested under the National Security Act for social media posts which said cow urine and dung did not cure the virus. (They were arrested under Section 153 of the Indian Penal Code for allegedly promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc and acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony).[375]
WHO's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan criticised politicians incautiously spreading such misinformation without evidence.[376]
A drug based on 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) was approved by the Drugs Controller General of India for emergency use as adjunct therapy in moderate to severe coronavirus patients.[377][378]
The drug was launched at a press conference with a false claim that it was approved by the World Health Organization.[379] It was developed by the DRDO along with Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, who stated in a press release, that the drug ""helps in faster recovery of hospitalised patients and reduces supplemental oxygen dependence.""[380][381][382] The Wire as well as The Hindu noted that the approval was based on poor evidence; no journal publication (or preprint) concerning efficacy and safety are yet available.[381][382]
Since its third version, the COVID management guidelines from the Chinese National Health Commission recommends using Traditional Chinese medicines to treat the disease.[383] In Wuhan, China Central Television reported that local authorities have pushed for a set of TCM prescriptions to be used for every case since early February.[384] One formula was promoted at the national level by mid-February.[385] The local field hospitals were explicitly TCM-oriented. According to state media, as of 16 March 2020, 91.91% of all Hubei patients have used TCM, with the rate reaching 99% in field hospitals and 94% in bulk quarantine areas.[386] In March 2020, the online insert of the official People's Daily, distributed in The Daily Telegraph, published an article stating that Traditional Chinese medicine ""helps fight coronavirus.""[387]
There were claims that chloroquine was used to cure more than 12,000 COVID-19 patients in Nigeria.[388]
On 11 March 2020, Adrian Bye, a tech startup leader who is not a doctor, suggested to cryptocurrency investors Gregory Rigano and James Todaro that ""chloroquine will keep most people out of hospital."" (Bye later admitted that he had reached this conclusion through ""philosophy"" rather than medical research.) Two days later, Rigano and Todaro promoted chloroquine in a self-published article that claimed affiliation with the Stanford University School of Medicine, the National Academy of Sciences and the Birmingham School of Medicine – the three institutions mentioned that they had no links to the article, and Google removed the article for violating its terms of service.[389]
In December 2020, Chair of the US Senate Homeland Security Committee Ron Johnson used a Senate hearing to promote fringe theories about COVID-19.[390] Among the witnesses was Pierre Kory, a pulmonary and critical care doctor, who erroneously described ivermectin as ""miraculous"" and as a ""wonder drug"" to be used against COVID-19. Video footage of his statements went viral on social media, receiving over one million views as of 11 December.[391] In the United Kingdom Andrew Hill, a senior research fellow at Liverpool University, posted a video of a draft meta-analysis that went viral before it was removed.[392]
During the pandemic, a number of misleading websites appeared purporting to show meta-analyses of clinical evidence in favour of ivermectin and sporting colorful graphics. While these gained traction in social media they violated the necessary norms of scientific practice, and the misinformation they contained created confusion among the public and policy makers.[393]
A review article by Kory, Paul E. Marik, and others on the efficacy of ivermectin, which had been provisionally accepted for publication by a Frontiers Media journal, was subsequently rejected on account of what the publisher said were ""a series of strong, unsupported claims based on studies with insufficient statistical significance"" meaning that the article did ""not offer an objective [or] balanced scientific contribution to the evaluation of ivermectin as a potential treatment for COVID-19.""[394]
In the United States, the use of ivermectin for COVID-19 is championed by a group calling itself the ""Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance"" (FLCCC), which says it heads ""the global movement to move #Ivermectin into the mainstream."" The effort has gone viral on social media, where it has been adopted by COVID deniers, anti-vaccination proponents, and conspiracy theorists.[395] David Gorski has written that the narrative of ivermectin as a ""miracle cure"" for COVID-19 is a ""metastasized"" version of a similar conspiracy theory around the drug hydroxychloroquine, in which unspecified powers are thought to be suppressing news of the drug's effectiveness for their own profit.[396]
The viral social media misinformation about ivermectin has gained particular attention in South Africa where an anti-vaccination group called ""South Africa Has A Right To Ivermectin"" has been lobbying for the drug to be made available for prescription.[392] Another group, the ""Ivermectin Interest Group"" launched a court case against the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA), and as a result a compassionate use exemption was granted. SAPHRA stated in April 2021 that ""At present, there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 infections.""[392]
Some QAnon proponents, including Jordan Sather and others, have promoted gargling ""Miracle Mineral Supplement"" (actually chlorine dioxide, a chemical used in some industrial applications as a bleach that may cause life-threatening reactions and even death) as a way of preventing or curing the disease. The Food and Drug Administration has warned multiple times that drinking MMS is ""dangerous"" as it may cause ""severe vomiting"" and ""acute liver failure.""[397]
In February 2020, televangelist Jim Bakker promoted a colloidal silver solution, sold on his website, as a remedy for coronavirus COVID-19; naturopath Sherrill Sellman, a guest on his show, falsely stated that it ""hasn't been tested on this strain of the coronavirus, but it's been tested on other strains of the coronavirus and has been able to eliminate it within 12 hours.""[398] The US Food and Drug Administration and New York Attorney General's office both issued cease-and-desist orders against Bakker, and he was sued by the state of Missouri over the sales.[399][400]
The New York Attorney General's office also issued a cease-and-desist order to radio host Alex Jones, who was selling silver-infused toothpaste that he falsely claimed could kill the virus and had been verified by federal officials,[401] causing a Jones spokesman to deny the products had been sold for the purpose of treating any disease.[402] The FDA would later threaten Jones with legal action and seizure of several silver-based products if he continued to promote their use against coronavirus.[403]
The yoga guru Ramdev claimed that one can treat coronavirus by pouring mustard oil through the nose, causing the virus to flow into the stomach where it would be destroyed by gastric acid. He also claimed that if a person holds his breath for a minute, it means s/he is not suffering from any type of coronavirus, symptomatic or asymptomatic. Both these claims were found to be false.[404][405]
Misinformation that the government is spreading an ""anti-corona"" drug in the country during Janata curfew, a stay-at-home curfew enforced in India, went viral on social media.[407]
Following the first reported case of COVID-19 in Nigeria on 28 February, untested cures and treatments began to spread via platforms such as WhatsApp.[408]
In March 2020, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested actor Keith Lawrence Middlebrook for wire fraud with a fake COVID-19 cure.[409]
Another televangelist, Kenneth Copeland, claimed on Victory Channel during a programme called ""Standing Against Coronavirus"", that he can cure television viewers of COVID-19 directly from the television studio. The viewers had to touch the television screen to receive the spiritual healing.[410][411]
Social media posts and internet memes claimed that COVID-19 derives from ""Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease 19"", or similar, as supposedly the ""19th virus to come out of China.""[412] In fact, the WHO named the disease as follows: CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).[413]
Claims that The Simpsons had predicted the COVID-19 pandemic in 1993, accompanied by a doctored screenshot from the show (where the text ""Corona Virus"" was layered over the original text ""Apocalypse Meow"", without blocking it from view), were later found to be false. The claim had been widely spread on social media.[414][415]
During the pandemic, many false and misleading images or news reports about the environmental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were shared by clickbait journalism sources and social media.[416]
A viral post that originated on Weibo and spread on Twitter claimed that a pack of elephants descended on a village under quarantine in China's Yunnan, got drunk on corn wine, and passed out in a tea garden.[417] A Chinese news report debunked the claim that the elephants got drunk on corn wine and noted that wild elephants were a common sight in the village; the image attached to the post was originally taken at the Asian Elephant Research Center in Yunnan in December 2019.[416]
Following reports of reduced pollution levels in Italy as a result of lockdowns, images purporting to show swans and dolphins swimming in Venice canals went viral on social media. The image of the swans was revealed to have been taken in Burano, where swans are common, while footage of the dolphins was filmed at a port in Sardinia hundreds of miles away.[416] The Venice mayor's office clarified that the reported water clarity in the canals was due to the lack of sediment being kicked up by boat traffic, not a reduction in water pollution as initially reported.[418]
Following the lockdown of India, a video clip purporting to show the extremely rare Malabar civet (a critically endangered, possibly extinct, species) walking the empty streets of Meppayur went viral on social media. Experts later identified the civet in the video as actually being the much commoner small Indian civet.[419] Another viral Indian video clip showed a pod of humpback whales allegedly returning to the Arabian Sea offshore from Mumbai following the shutdown of shipping routes; however, this video was found to have actually been taken in 2019 in the Java Sea.[420]
It has been wrongly claimed that anyone infected with COVID-19 will have the virus in their bodies for life. While there is no curative treatment, most infected people recover from the disease and eliminate the virus from their bodies.[146]
On 2 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described a ""massive infodemic"", citing an over-abundance of reported information, which was false, about the virus that ""makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it."" The WHO stated that the high demand for timely and trustworthy information has incentivised the creation of a direct WHO 24/7 myth-busting hotline where its communication and social media teams have been monitoring and responding to misinformation through its website and social media pages.[421][422][423] The WHO specifically debunked several claims as false, including the claim that a person can tell if they have the virus or not simply by holding their breath; the claim that drinking large amounts of water will protect against the virus; and the claim that gargling salt water prevents infection.[424]
In early February 2020, Facebook, Twitter, and Google announced that they were working with WHO to address misinformation.[425] In a blog post, Facebook stated that it would remove content flagged by global health organizations and local authorities that violate its content policy on misinformation leading to ""physical harm.""[426] Facebook is also giving free advertising to WHO.[427] Nonetheless, a week after Trump's speculation that sunlight could kill the virus, the New York Times found ""780 Facebook groups, 290 Facebook pages, nine Instagram accounts and thousands of tweets pushing UV light therapies,"" content which those companies declined to remove from their platforms.[428] On 11 August 2020, Facebook removed seven million posts with misinformation about COVID-19.[429]
At the end of February 2020, Amazon removed more than a million products that claimed to cure or protect against coronavirus, and removed tens of thousands of listings for health products whose prices were ""significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon"", although numerous items were ""still being sold at unusually high prices"" as of 28 February.[430]
Millions of instances of COVID-19 misinformation have occurred across a number of online platforms.[431] Other fake news researchers noted certain rumors started in China; many of them later spread to Korea and the United States, prompting several universities in Korea to start the multilingual ""Facts Before Rumors"" campaign to evaluate common claims seen online.[432][433][434][435]
The proliferation of COVID-19 misinformation on social media has led to workshops for the application of machine learning resources to misinformation detection. Some workshops are listed below:
In addition, the divisive nature of the issue, being mired in existing political tensions, has led to online bullying of scientists.[26]
The media have praised Wikipedia's coverage of COVID-19 and its combating the inclusion of misinformation through efforts led by the WikiProject Med Foundation and the English-language Wikipedia's WikiProject Medicine, among other groups.[441][442][443] WHO began working with Wikipedia to provide much of its infographics and reports on COVID-19 to help fight misinformation, with plans to use similar approaches for fighting misinformation about other infectious diseases in the future.[444]
Initially, many newspapers with paywalls lowered them for some or all their coronavirus coverage.[445][446] Many scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak open access (free).[447]
The scientific publishing community, while intent on producing quality scholarly publications, has itself been negatively impacted by the infiltration of inferior or false research leading to the retraction of several articles on the topic of COVID-19, as well as polluting valid and reliable scientific study, bringing into question the reliability of research undertaken.[448] Retraction Watch maintains a database of retracted COVID-19 articles.[449]
In many countries, censorship was performed by governments, with ""fake news"" laws being enacted to criminalize certain types of speech regarding the coronavirus. Often, people were arrested for making posts online.
In March 2020, the Turkish Interior Ministry reported 93 suspects and 19 arrests of social media users whose posts were ""targeting officials and spreading panic and fear by suggesting the virus had spread widely in Turkey and that officials had taken insufficient measures.""[450] In April 2020, Iran's military said that 3600 people had been arrested for ""spreading rumors"" about coronavirus in the country.[451] In Cambodia, at least 17 individuals who expressed concerns about the spread of COVID-19 were arrested between January and March 2020 on ""fake news"" charges.[452][453] In April 2020, Algerian lawmakers passed a law criminalizing ""fake news"" deemed harmful to ""public order and state security.""[454]
In the Philippines,[455] China,[456] India,[457][458] Egypt,[459] Ethiopia,[460] Bangladesh,[461] Morocco,[462] Pakistan,[463] Saudi Arabia,[464] Oman,[465] Iran,[466] Vietnam, Laos,[467] Indonesia,[458] Mongolia,[458] Sri Lanka,[468] Kenya, South Africa,[469] Cote d’Ivoire,[470] Somalia,[471] Mauritius,[472] Zimbabwe,[473] Thailand,[474] Kazakhstan,[475] Azerbaijan,[476] Montenegro,[477] Serbia,[478][479] Malaysia,[480] Singapore,[481][482] and Hong Kong, people have been arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the COVID-19 pandemic.[458][483] The United Arab Emirates has introduced criminal penalties for the spread of misinformation and rumours related to the outbreak.[484] Myanmar blocked access to 221 news websites,[485] including several leading media outlets.[486]
The UN WHO has warned of criminal scams involving perpetrators who misrepresent themselves as representatives of the WHO seeking personal information from victims via email or phone.[487] Also, the Federal Communications Commission has advised consumers not to click on links in suspicious emails and not to give out personal information in emails, text messages or phone calls.[488] The Federal Trade Commission has also warned on charity scams related to the pandemic, and has advised consumers not to donate in cash, gift cards, or wire transfers.[489]
Cybersecurity firm Check Point stated there has been a large increase in phishing attacks to lure victims into unwittingly installing a computer virus under the guise of coronavirus-themed emails containing attachments. Cyber-criminals use deceptive domains such as ""cdc-gov.org"" instead of the correct ""cdc.gov"", or even spoof the original domain so it resembles specific websites. More than 4,000 coronavirus-related domains have been registered.[490]
Police in New Jersey, United States reported incidents of criminals knocking on people's doors and claiming to be from the CDC. They then attempt to sell products at inflated prices or otherwise scam victims under the guise of educating and protecting the public from the coronavirus.[491]
Links that purportedly direct to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus map, but instead direct to a false site that spreads malware, have been circulating on the Internet.[492][493]
Since the passage in March 2020 of the CARES Act, criminals have taken advantage of the stimulus bill by asking people to pay in advance to receive their stimulus payment. Because of this, the IRS has advised consumers to only use the official IRS coronavirus web address to submit information to the IRS (and not in response to a text, email, or phone call).[494] In response to these schemes, many financial companies, like Wells Fargo[495] and LoanDepot,[496] as well as health insurers, like Humana,[497] for example, have posted similar advisories on their websites.

5,Social distancing,"
In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing,[2][3][4] is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other.[2][5] It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others (the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time) and avoiding gathering together in large groups.[6][7]
By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths.[2] The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene, face masks and hand washing.[8][9] To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic, several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation, quarantine, restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of mass gatherings.[5][10] Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness, reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction.[11]
Social distancing measures are most effective when the infectious disease spreads via one or more of the following methods, droplet contact (coughing or sneezing), direct physical contact (including sexual contact), indirect physical contact (such as by touching a contaminated surface), and airborne transmission (if the microorganism can survive in the air for long periods). The measures are less effective when an infection is transmitted primarily via contaminated water or food or by vectors such as mosquitoes or other insects.[12] Authorities have encouraged or mandated social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic as it is an important method of preventing transmission of COVID-19. COVID-19 is much more likely to spread over short distances than long ones. However, it can spread over distances longer than 2m (6 ft) in enclosed, poorly ventilated places and with prolonged exposure.[13]
Although the term ""social distancing"" was not introduced until the 21st century,[14] social-distancing measures date back to at least the 5th century BC. The Bible contains one of the earliest known references to the practice in the Book of Leviticus 13:46: ""And the leper in whom the plague is... he shall dwell alone; [outside] the camp shall his habitation be.""[15] During the Plague of Justinian of 541 to 542, Emperor Justinian enforced an ineffective quarantine on the Byzantine Empire, including dumping bodies into the sea; he predominantly blamed the widespread outbreak on ""Jews, Samaritans, pagans, heretics, Arians, Montanists and homosexuals"".[16] In modern times, social distancing measures have been successfully implemented in several epidemics. In St. Louis, shortly after the first cases of influenza were detected in the city during the 1918 flu pandemic, authorities implemented school closures, bans on public gatherings and other social-distancing interventions. The influenza fatality rates in St. Louis were much less than in Philadelphia, which had fewer cases of influenza but allowed a mass parade to continue and did not introduce social distancing until more than two weeks after its first cases.[17]
The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested using the term ""physical distancing"" instead of ""social distancing"" because it is physical separation which prevents transmission; people can remain socially connected by meeting outdoors at a safe distance (when there is no stay-at-home order) and by meeting via technology.[2][3][18][19]
The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have described social distancing as a set of ""methods for reducing frequency and closeness of contact between people in order to decrease the risk of transmission of disease"".[10] During the 2009 flu pandemic the WHO described social distancing as ""keeping at least an arm's length distance from others, [and] minimizing gatherings"".[8] During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC defined social distancing as ""remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately six feet or two meters) from others when possible"".[6][7]
Social distancing, combined with the use of face masks, good respiratory hygiene and hand washing, is considered the most feasible way to reduce or delay a pandemic.[8][20]
Several social distancing measures are used to control the spread of contagious illnesses. Research indicates that measures must be applied rigorously and immediately in order to be effective.[25]
Keeping a set physical distance from each other and avoiding hugs and gestures that involve direct physical contact, reduce the risk of becoming infected during outbreaks of infectious respiratory diseases (for example, flu pandemics and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.)[6][26] These distances of separation, in addition to personal hygiene measures, are also recommended at places of work.[27] Where possible it may be recommended to work from home.[9][28]
The distance advised by authorities varies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, the World Health Organization recommends that a distance of 1 m (3.3 ft) or more is safe. Subsequently, China, Denmark, France, Hong Kong, Lithuania and Singapore adopted a 1 m social distancing policy. South Korea adopted 1.4 m (4.6 ft). Australia, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain adopted 1.5 m (4.9 ft). The United States adopted 6 ft (1.8 m), and Canada adopted 2 m (6.6 ft). The United Kingdom first advised 2 m, then on July 4, 2020 reduced this to ""one metre plus"" where other methods of mitigation such as face masks were in use.[29]
The WHO's one-metre recommendation stems from research into droplet-based transmission of tuberculosis by William F. Wells, which had found that droplets produced by exhalation, coughs, or sneezes landed an average of 3 ft (0.9 m) from where they were expelled.[30][31][32] Quartz speculated that the U.S. CDC's adoption of 6 ft (1.8 m) may have stemmed from a study of SARS transmission on an airplane, published in The New England Journal of Medicine. When contacted, however, the CDC did not provide any specific information.[33]
Some have suggested that distances greater than 1–2 m (3.3–6.6 ft) should be observed.[34][35][36][37][38][39] One minute of loud speaking can produce oral droplets with a load of 7 million SARS-CoV-2 virus per milliliter that can remain for more than eight minutes,[40] a time-period during which many people could enter or remain in the area. A sneeze can distribute such droplets as far as 7 m (23 ft) or 8 m (26 ft).[41] Social distancing is less effective than face masks at reducing the spread of COVID-19.[42]
Various alternatives have been proposed for the tradition of handshaking. The gesture of namaste, placing one's palms together, fingers pointing upwards, drawing the hands to the heart, is one non-touch alternative. During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, this gesture was used by Prince Charles upon greeting reception guests, and has been recommended by the Director-General of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[43] Other alternatives include the popular thumbs up gesture, the wave, the shaka (or ""hang loose"") sign, and placing a palm on one's heart, as practiced in parts of Iran.[43]
In this computer lab, every other workstation has been closed off to increase the distance between people working, and screens between workstations are also in place.
Floor markings can help people maintain distance in public places, especially when queueing.
Urinals adjusted in a way close contacts are less likely
Mathematical modeling has shown that transmission of an outbreak may be delayed by closing schools. However, effectiveness depends on the contacts children maintain outside of school. Often, one parent has to take time off work, and prolonged closures may be required. These factors could result in social and economic disruption.[45][46]
Modeling and simulation studies based on U.S. data suggest that if 10% of affected workplaces are closed, the overall infection transmission rate is around 11.9% and the epidemic peak time is slightly delayed. In contrast, if 33% of affected workplaces are closed, the attack rate decreases to 4.9%, and the peak time is delayed by one week.[47][48] Workplace closures include closure of ""non-essential"" businesses and social services (""non-essential"" means those facilities that do not maintain primary functions in the community, as opposed to essential services).[49][28]
Cancellation of mass gatherings includes sports events, films or musical shows.[50] Evidence suggesting that mass gatherings increase the potential for infectious disease transmission is inconclusive.[51] Anecdotal evidence suggests certain types of mass gatherings may be associated with increased risk of influenza transmission, and may also ""seed"" new strains into an area, instigating community transmission in a pandemic. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, military parades in Philadelphia[52] and Boston[53] may have been responsible for spreading the disease by mixing infected sailors with crowds of civilians. Restricting mass gatherings, in combination with other social distancing interventions, may help reduce transmission.[28][54] A recent peer-reviewed study in the British Medical Journal (The BMJ) also suggested it as one of the key components of an effective strategy in reducing the burden of COVID-19.[24]
Border restrictions or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay an epidemic by more than two to three weeks unless implemented with over 99% coverage.[55] Airport screening was found to be ineffective in preventing viral transmission during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Canada[56] and the U.S.[57] Strict border controls between Austria and the Ottoman Empire, imposed from 1770 until 1871 to prevent persons infected with the bubonic plague from entering Austria, were reportedly effective, as there were no major outbreaks of plague in Austrian territory after they were established, whereas the Ottoman Empire continued to suffer frequent epidemics of plague until the mid-nineteenth century.[58][59]
A Northeastern University study published in March 2020 found that ""travel restrictions to and from China only slow down the international spread of COVID-19 [when] combined with efforts to reduce transmission on a community and an individual level. ... Travel restrictions aren't enough unless we couple it with social distancing.""[60] The study found that the travel ban in Wuhan delayed the spread of the disease to other parts of mainland China only by three to five days, although it did reduce the spread of international cases by as much as 80 percent.[61]
Shielding measures for individuals include limiting face-to-face contacts, conducting business by phone or online, avoiding public places and reducing unnecessary travel.[62][63][64] During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, shielding referred to special advisory measures put in place by the UK Government to protect those at the highest risk of serious illness from the disease. This included those with weakened immune systems (such as organ transplant recipients), as well as those with certain medical conditions such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma. Until June 1, 2020, those shielding were strongly advised not to leave home for any reason at all, including essential travel, and to maintain a 2 m (6.6 ft) distance from anyone else in their household. Supermarkets quickly made priority grocery delivery slots available to those shielding, and the Government arranged for food boxes to be sent to those shielding who needed additional assistance, for example elderly people shielding on their own. This was gradually relaxed from June to allow shielders to spend more time outside, before being suspended indefinitely from August 1.
During the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore, approximately 8000 people were subjected to mandatory home quarantine and an additional 4300 were required to self-monitor for symptoms and make daily telephone contact with health authorities as a means of controlling the epidemic. Although only 58 of these individuals were eventually diagnosed with SARS, public health officials were satisfied that this measure assisted in preventing further spread of the infection.[65] Voluntary self-isolation may have helped reduce transmission of influenza in Texas in 2009.[66] Short and long-term negative psychological effects have been reported.[11]
The objective of stay-at-home orders is to reduce day-to-day contact between people and thereby reduce the spread of infection[67] During the COVID-19 pandemic, early and aggressive implementation of stay-at-home orders was effective in ""flattening the curve"" and provided the much needed time for healthcare systems to increase their capacity while reducing the number of peak cases during the initial wave of illness.[28] It is important for public health authorities to follow disease trends closely to re-implement appropriate social distancing policies, including stay-at-home orders, if secondary COVID-19 waves appear.[28]
In 1995, a cordon sanitaire was used to control an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Kikwit, Zaire.[68][69][70] President Mobutu Sese Seko surrounded the town with troops and suspended all flights into the community. Inside Kikwit, the World Health Organization and Zaire's medical teams erected further cordons sanitaires, isolating burial and treatment zones from the general population and successfully containing the infection.[71]
During the 1918 influenza epidemic, the town of Gunnison, Colorado, isolated itself for two months to prevent an introduction of the infection. Highways were barricaded and arriving train passengers were quarantined for five days. As a result of the isolation, no one died of influenza in Gunnison during the epidemic.[72] Several other communities adopted similar measures.[73]
Other measures include shutting down or limiting mass transit[74] and closure of sport facilities (community swimming pools, youth clubs, gymnasiums).[75] Due to the highly interconnected nature of modern transportation hubs, a highly contagious illness can achieve rapid geographic spread if appropriate mitigation measures are not taken early.[28] Consequently, highly coordinated efforts must be put into place early during an outbreak to proactively monitor, detect, and isolate any potentially infectious individuals.[28] If community spread is present, more aggressive measures may be required, up to and including complete cessation of travel in/out of a specific geographic area.[28]
Leper colonies and lazarettos were established as a means of preventing the spread of leprosy and other contagious diseases through social distancing,[76] until transmission was understood and effective treatments invented.
The Lazzaretto of Ancona was constructed in the 18th century on an artificial island to serve as a quarantine station and leprosarium for the port town of Ancona, Italy.

During the 1916 New York City polio epidemic, when there were more than 27,000 cases and more than 6,000 deaths due to polio in the United States, with more than 2,000 deaths in New York City alone, movie theaters were closed, meetings were cancelled, public gatherings were almost non-existent, and children were warned not to drink from water fountains, and told to avoid amusement parks, swimming pools and beaches.[78][79]
During the influenza pandemic of 1918, Philadelphia saw its first cases of influenza on 17 September.[80][17] The city continued with its planned parade and gathering of more than 200000 people on 28 September and over the subsequent three days, the city's 31 hospitals became fully occupied. During the week ending 16 October, over 4500 people died.[52][81] Social distancing measures were introduced on 3 October, on the orders of St. Louis physician Max C. Starkloff,[82] more than two weeks after the first case.[17] Unlike Philadelphia, St. Louis experienced its first cases of influenza on 5 October and the city took two days to implement several social distancing measures,[17] including closing schools, theatres, and other places where people get together. It banned public gatherings, including funerals. The actions slowed the spread of influenza in St. Louis and a spike in cases and deaths, as had happened in Philadelphia, did not occur.[83] The final death rate in St. Louis increased following a second wave of cases, but remained overall less than in other cities.[84] Bootsma and Ferguson analyzed social distancing interventions in sixteen U.S. cities during the 1918 epidemic and found that time-limited interventions reduced total mortality only moderately (perhaps 10–30%), and that the impact was often very limited because the interventions were introduced too late and lifted too early. It was observed that several cities experienced a second epidemic peak after social distancing controls were lifted, because susceptible individuals who had been protected were now exposed.[85]
School closures were shown to reduce morbidity from the Asian flu by 90% during the 1957–1958 pandemic,[86] and up to 50% in controlling influenza in the U.S., 2004–2008.[87] Similarly, mandatory school closures and other social distancing measures were associated with a 29% to 37% reduction in influenza transmission rates during the 2009 flu epidemic in Mexico.[88]
The 2009 swine flu pandemic caused social distancing to rise in popularity, most notably in Mexico, with the country's Ministry of Health advising people to avoid handshakes and kissing as ways of greeting people.[89] A mandatory nationwide school closure enacted in Mexico, which lasted for 18 days from late April 2009 to early May 2009, was a form of social distancing aimed at reducing the transmission of Swine flu.[90] A study from 2011 found the mandatory nationwide school closure and other forms of social distancing in Mexico were effective at reducing influenza transmission rates.[90]
During the swine flu outbreak in 2009 in the UK, in an article titled ""Closure of schools during an influenza pandemic"" published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, a group of epidemiologists endorsed the closure of schools to interrupt the course of the infection, slow the further spread and buy time to research and produce a vaccine.[91] Having studied previous influenza pandemics including the 1918 flu pandemic, the influenza pandemic of 1957 and the 1968 flu pandemic, they reported on the economic and workforce effect school closure would have, particularly with a large percentage of doctors and nurses being women, of whom half had children under the age of 16. They also looked at the dynamics of the spread of influenza in France during French school holidays and noted that cases of flu dropped when schools closed and re-emerged when they re-opened. They noted that when teachers in Israel went on strike during the flu season of 1999–2000, visits to doctors and the number of respiratory infections dropped by more than a fifth and more than two fifths respectively.[92]
During the SARS outbreak of 2003, social distancing measures were implemented, such as banning large gatherings, closing schools and theaters, and other public places, supplemented public health measures such as finding and isolating affected people, quarantining their close contacts, and infection control procedures. This was combined with the wearing of masks for certain people.[93] During this time in Canada, ""community quarantine"" was used to reduce transmission of the disease with moderate success.[94]
During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and related measures are emphasized by several governments as alternatives to an enforced quarantine of heavily affected areas.[28] According to UNESCO monitoring, more than a hundred countries have implemented nationwide school closures in response to COVID-19, impacting over half the world's student population.[96] In the United Kingdom, the government advised the public to avoid public spaces, and cinemas and theaters voluntarily closed to encourage the government's message.[97]
With many people disbelieving that COVID-19 is any worse than the seasonal flu,[98] it has been difficult to convince the public—particularly youth, and the anti vaxx community to voluntarily adopt social distancing practices.[99][100] In Belgium, media reported a rave was attended by at least 300 before it was broken up by local authorities. In France, teens making nonessential trips are fined up to US$150. Beaches were closed in Florida and Alabama to disperse partygoers during spring break.[101] Weddings were broken up in New Jersey and an 8 p.m. curfew was imposed in Newark. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania were the first states to adopt coordinated social distancing policies which closed down non-essential businesses and restricted large gatherings. Shelter in place orders in California were extended to the entire state on 19 March. On the same day Texas declared a public disaster and imposed statewide restrictions.[102]
These preventive measures such as social-distancing and self-isolation prompted the widespread closure of primary, secondary, and post-secondary schools in more than 120 countries. As of 23 March 2020, more than 1.2 billion learners were out of school due to school closures in response to COVID-19.[96] Given low rates of COVID-19 symptoms among children, the effectiveness of school closures has been called into question.[103] Even when school closures are temporary, it carries high social and economic costs.[104] However, the significance of children in spreading COVID-19 is unclear.[105][106] While the full impact of school closures during the coronavirus pandemic are not yet known, UNESCO advises that school closures have negative impacts on local economies and on learning outcomes for students.[107]
In early March 2020, the sentiment ""Stay Home"" was coined by Florian Reifschneider, a German engineer and was quickly echoed by notable celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande[108][109] and Busy Philipps[110] in hopes of reducing and delaying the peak of the outbreak. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram also joined the campaign with similar hashtags, stickers and filters under #staythefhome, #stayhome, #staythefuckhome and began trending across social media.[111][112][113][114] The website claims to have reached about two million people online and says the text has been translated into 17 languages.[114]
There are concerns that social distancing can have adverse affects on participants' mental health.[28][115] It may lead to stress, anxiety, depression or panic, especially for individuals with preexisting conditions such as anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, and paranoia.[28][116] Widespread media coverage about a pandemic, its impact on economy, and resulting hardships may create anxiety. Change in daily circumstances and uncertainty about the future may add onto the mental stress of being away from other people.[28][117]
People with autism also suffer impact from social distancing. Adjusting to a new routine can be stressful for everyone within the spectrum but especially for children who have trouble with change.[118][119] Children with autism may not know what is going on or might not be able to express their fears and frustrations.[118] They also may need extra support to understand what's expected of them in some situations.[118][119] The adjustment to a new situation can lead to challenging behavior uncharacteristic of the autistic individual's true character.[119] In some countries and demographics, teenagers and young adults within the autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) receive support services including special education, behavioral therapy, occupational therapy, speech services, and individual aides through school, but this can be a major challenge, particularly since many teenagers with ASD already have social and communication difficulties.[120] Aggressive and self-injurious behaviors may increase during this time of fear and uncertainty.[120]
In his 1957 science fiction novel The Naked Sun, Isaac Asimov portrays a planet where people live with social distancing. They are spread out, miles from each other, across a sparsely-populated world. Communication is primarily through technology. A male and a female still need to engage in sex to make a baby, but it is seen as a dangerous, nasty chore. In contrast, when communication is through technology the situation is the reverse: there is no modesty, and casual nudity is frequent. The novel's point of departure is a murder: this seemingly idyllic world, in fact, has serious social problems.
From the perspective of epidemiology, the basic goal behind social distancing is to decrease the effective reproduction number,
or
, which in the absence of social distancing would equate to the basic reproduction number, i.e. the average number of secondary infected individuals generated from one primary infected individual in a population where all individuals are equally susceptible to a disease. In a basic model of social distancing,[121] where a proportion
of the population engages in social distancing to decrease their interpersonal contacts to a fraction
of their normal contacts, the new effective reproduction number
is given by:[121]


Where the value of
can be brought below 1 for sufficiently long, containment is achieved, and the number infected should decrease.[122]
For any given period of time, the growth in the number of infections can be modeled as:[123]


where:
Using COVID-19 as an example, the following table shows the infection spread given:
An empirical study published in July 2020 in The BMJ (British Medical Journal) analyzed data from 149 countries, and reported an average of 13% reduction in COVID-19 incidence after the implementation of social distancing policies.[24] Another study found that four social distancing interventions combined resulted in a reduction of the infection rate from 66% to less than 1%.[124]
Animals also practice social distancing to avoid disease.[125]

6,Transmission (medicine),"In medicine, public health, and biology, transmission is the passing of a pathogen causing communicable disease from an infected host individual or group to a particular individual or group, regardless of whether the other individual was previously infected.[1]
The term strictly refers to the transmission of microorganisms directly from one individual to another by one or more of the following means:
Transmission can also be indirect, via another organism, either a vector (e.g. a mosquito or fly) or an intermediate host (e.g. tapeworm in pigs can be transmitted to humans who ingest improperly cooked pork). Indirect transmission could involve zoonoses or, more typically, larger pathogens like macroparasites with more complex life cycles. Transmissions can be autochthonous (i.e. between two individuals in the same place) or may involve travel of the microorganism or the affected hosts.
An infectious disease agent can be transmitted in two ways: as horizontal disease agent transmission from one individual to another in the same generation (peers in the same age group)[2] by either direct contact (licking, touching, biting), or indirect contact through air – cough or sneeze (vectors or fomites that allow the transmission of the agent causing the disease without physical contact)[3] or by vertical disease transmission, passing the agent causing the disease from parent to offspring, such as in prenatal or perinatal transmission.[4]
The term infectivity describes the ability of an organism to enter, survive and multiply in the host, while the infectiousness of a disease agent indicates the comparative ease with which the disease agent is transmitted to other hosts.[5] Transmission of pathogens can occur by direct contact, through contaminated food, body fluids or objects, by airborne inhalation or through vector organisms.[6]
Transmissibility is the probability of an infection, given a contact between an infected host and a noninfected host.[7]
Community transmission means that the source of infection for the spread of an illness is unknown or a link in terms of contacts between patients and other people is missing. It refers to the difficulty in grasping the epidemiological link in the community beyond confirmed cases.[8][9][10]
Local transmission means that the source of the infection has been identified within the reporting location (such as within a country, region or city).[11]
The route of transmission is important to epidemiologists because patterns of contact vary between different populations and different groups of populations depending on socio-economic, cultural and other features. For example, low personal and food hygiene due to the lack of a clean water supply may result in increased transmission of diseases by the fecal-oral route, such as cholera. Differences in incidence of such diseases between different groups can also throw light on the routes of transmission of the disease. For example, if it is noted that polio is more common in cities in underdeveloped countries, without a clean water supply, than in cities with a good plumbing system, we might advance the theory that polio is spread by the fecal-oral route. Two routes are considered to be airborne: Airborne infections and droplet infections.
""Airborne transmission refers to infectious agents that are spread via droplet nuclei (residue from evaporated droplets) containing infective microorganisms. These organisms can survive outside the body and remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. They infect others via the upper and lower respiratory tracts.""[12] The size of the particles for airborne infections need to be < 5 μm.[13] It includes both dry and wet aerosols and thus requires usually higher levels of isolation since it can stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time. i.e., separate ventilation systems or negative pressure environments are needed to avoid general contamination. e.g., tuberculosis, chickenpox, measles.
A common form of transmission is by way of respiratory droplets, generated by coughing, sneezing, or talking. Respiratory droplet transmission is the usual route for respiratory infections. Transmission can occur when respiratory droplets reach susceptible mucosal surfaces, such as in the eyes, nose or mouth. This can also happen indirectly via contact with contaminated surfaces when hands then touch the face. Before drying, respiratory droplets are large and cannot remain suspended in the air for long, and are usually dispersed over short distances.[12] The size of the particles for droplet infections are > 5 μm.[13]
Organisms spread by droplet transmission include respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, Bordetella pertussis, pneumococci, streptococcus pyogenes, diphtheria, rubella,[15] and coronaviruses.[16] Spread of respiratory droplets from the wearer can be reduced through wearing of a surgical mask.[14]
Direct contact occurs through skin-to-skin contact, kissing, and sexual intercourse. Direct contact also refers to contact with soil or vegetation harboring infectious organisms.[17] Additionally, while fecal–oral transmission is primarily considered an indirect contact route, direct contact can also result in transmission through feces.[18][19]
Diseases that can be transmitted by direct contact are called contagious (contagious is not the same as infectious; although all contagious diseases are infectious, not all infectious diseases are contagious). These diseases can also be transmitted by sharing a towel (where the towel is rubbed vigorously on both bodies) or items of clothing in close contact with the body (socks, for example) if they are not washed thoroughly between uses. For this reason, contagious diseases often break out in schools, where towels are shared and personal items of clothing accidentally swapped in the changing rooms.
Some diseases that are transmissible by direct contact include athlete's foot, impetigo, syphilis, warts, and conjunctivitis.[20]
This refers to any disease that can be caught during sexual activity with another person, including vaginal or anal sex or (less commonly) through oral sex (see below). Transmission is either directly between surfaces in contact during intercourse (the usual route for bacterial infections and those infections causing sores) or from secretions (semen or the fluid secreted by the excited female) which carry infectious agents that get into the partner's blood stream through tiny tears in the penis, vagina or rectum (this is a more usual route for viruses). In this second case, anal sex is considerably more hazardous since the penis opens more tears in the rectum than the vagina, as the vagina is more elastic and more accommodating.[citation needed]
Some diseases transmissible by the sexual route include HIV/AIDS, chlamydia, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, syphilis, herpes, and trichomoniasis.
Sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV and hepatitis B are thought to not normally be transmitted through mouth-to-mouth contact, although it is possible to transmit some STDs between the genitals and the mouth, during oral sex. In the case of HIV this possibility has been established. It is also responsible for the increased incidence of herpes simplex virus 1 (which is usually responsible for oral infections) in genital infections and the increased incidence of the type 2 virus (more common genitally) in oral infections.[citation needed]
Diseases that are transmitted primarily by oral means may be caught through direct oral contact such as kissing, or by indirect contact such as by sharing a drinking glass or a cigarette. Diseases that are known to be transmissible by kissing or by other direct or indirect oral contact include all of the diseases transmissible by droplet contact and (at least) all forms of herpes viruses, namely Cytomegalovirus infections herpes simplex virus (especially HSV-1) and infectious mononucleosis.[citation needed]
This is from mother to child (more rarely father to child), often in utero, during childbirth (also referred to as perinatal infection) or during postnatal physical contact between parents and offspring. In mammals, including humans, it occurs also via breast milk (transmammary transmission). Infectious diseases that can be transmitted in this way include: HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis. Many mutualistic organisms are transmitted vertically.[21]
Transmission due to medical procedures, such as touching a wound, an injection or transplantation of infected material. Some diseases that can be transmitted iatrogenically include: Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease by injection of contaminated human growth hormone, MRSA and many more.[citation needed]
Indirect contact transmission, also known as vehicleborne transmission, involves transmission through contamination of inanimate objects. Vehicles that may indirectly transmit an infectious agent include food, water, biologic products such as blood, and fomites such as handkerchiefs, bedding, or surgical scalpels. A vehicle may passively carry a pathogen, as in the case of food or water may carrying hepatitis A virus. Alternatively, the vehicle may provide an environment in which the agent grows, multiplies, or produces toxin, such as improperly canned foods provide an environment that supports production of botulinum toxin by Clostridium botulinum.[17]
A vector is an organism that does not cause disease itself but that transmits infection by conveying pathogens from one host to another.[22]
Vectors may be mechanical or biological. A mechanical vector picks up an infectious agent on the outside of its body and transmits it in a passive manner. An example of a mechanical vector is a housefly, which lands on cow dung, contaminating its appendages with bacteria from the feces, and then lands on food prior to consumption. The pathogen never enters the body of the fly. In contrast, biological vectors harbor pathogens within their bodies and deliver pathogens to new hosts in an active manner, usually a bite. Biological vectors are often responsible for serious blood-borne diseases, such as malaria, viral encephalitis, Chagas disease, Lyme disease and African sleeping sickness. Biological vectors are usually, though not exclusively, arthropods, such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas and lice. Vectors are often required in the life cycle of a pathogen. A common strategy used to control vector-borne infectious diseases is to interrupt the life cycle of a pathogen by killing the vector.[citation needed]
In the fecal-oral route, pathogens in fecal particles pass from one person to the mouth of another person. Although it is usually discussed as a route of transmission, it is actually a specification of the entry and exit portals of the pathogen, and can operate across several of the other routes of transmission.[17] Fecal–oral transmission is primarily considered as an indirect contact route through contaminated food or water. However, it can also operate through direct contact with feces or contaminated body parts, such as through anal sex.[18][19] It can also operate through droplet or airborne transmission through the toilet plume from contaminated toilets.[23][24]
Main causes of fecal–oral disease transmission include lack of adequate sanitation and poor hygiene practices - which can take various forms. Fecal oral transmission can be via foodstuffs or water that has become contaminated. This can happen when people do not adequately wash their hands after using the toilet and before preparing food or tending to patients.
The fecal-oral route of transmission can be a public health risk for people in developing countries who live in urban slums without access to adequate sanitation. Here, excreta or untreated sewage can pollute drinking water sources (groundwater or surface water). The people who drink the polluted water can become infected. Another problem in some developing countries, is open defecation which leads to disease transmission via the fecal-oral route.
Even in developed countries there are periodic system failures resulting in a sanitary sewer overflow. This is the typical mode of transmission for infectious agents such as cholera, hepatitis A, polio, Rotavirus, Salmonella, and parasites (e.g. Ascaris lumbricoides).
Tracking the transmission of infectious diseases is called disease surveillance. Surveillance of infectious diseases in the public realm traditionally has been the responsibility of public health agencies, either on the (inter)national or a local level. Public health staff relies on health care workers and microbiology laboratories to report cases of reportable diseases to them. The analysis of aggregate data can show the spread of a disease and is at the core of the specialty of epidemiology. To understand the spread of the vast majority of non-notifiable diseases, data either need to be collected in a particular study, or existing data collections can be mined, such as insurance company data or antimicrobial drug sales for example.
For diseases transmitted within an institution, such as a hospital, prison, nursing home, boarding school, orphanage, refugee camp, etc., infection control specialists are employed, who will review medical records to analyze transmission as part of a hospital epidemiology program, for example.
Because these traditional methods are slow, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, proxies of transmission have been sought. One proxy in the case of influenza is tracking of influenza-like illness at certain sentinel sites of health care practitioners within a state, for example.[25] Tools have been developed to help track influenza epidemics by finding patterns in certain web search query activity. It was found that the frequency of influenza-related web searches as a whole rises as the number of people sick with influenza rises. Examining space-time relationships of web queries has been shown to approximate the spread of influenza[26] and dengue.[27]
Computer simulations of infectious disease spread have been used.[28] Human aggregation can drive transmission, seasonal variation and outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the annual start of school, bootcamp, the annual Hajj etc. Most recently, data from cell phones have been shown to be able to capture population movements well enough to predict the transmission of certain infectious diseases, like rubella.[29]
Pathogens must have a way to be transmitted from one host to another to ensure their species' survival. Infectious agents are generally specialized for a particular method of transmission. Taking an example from the respiratory route, from an evolutionary perspective viruses or bacteria that cause their host to develop coughing and sneezing symptoms have a great survival advantage, as they are much more likely to be ejected from one host and carried to another. This is also the reason that many microorganisms cause diarrhea.
The relationship between virulence and transmission is complex and has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. Since it takes many generations for a microbe and a new host species to co-evolve, an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can be passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing and coughing create infectious aerosols).
The mode of transmission is also an important aspect of the biology of beneficial microbial symbionts, such as coral-associated dinoflagellates or human microbiota. Organisms can form symbioses with microbes transmitted from their parents, from the environment or unrelated individuals, or both.
Vertical transmission refers to acquisition of symbionts from parents (usually mothers). Vertical transmission can be intracellular (e.g. transovarial), or extracellular (for example through post-embryonic contact between parents and offspring). Both intracellular and extracellular vertical transmission can be considered a form of non-genetic inheritance or parental effect. It has been argued that most organisms experience some form of vertical transmission of symbionts.[30] Canonical examples of vertically transmitted symbionts include the nutritional symbiont Buchnera in aphids (transovarially transmitted intracellular symbiont) and some components of the human microbiota (transmitted during passage of infants through the birth canal and also through breastfeeding).
Some beneficial symbionts are acquired horizontally, from the environment or unrelated individuals. This requires that host and symbiont have some method of recognizing each other or each other's products or services. Often, horizontally acquired symbionts are relevant to secondary rather than primary metabolism, for example for use in defense against pathogens,[31] but some primary nutritional symbionts are also horizontally (environmentally) acquired.[32] Additional examples of horizontally transmitted beneficial symbionts include bioluminescent bacteria associated with bobtail squid and nitrogen-fixing bacteria in plants.
Many microbial symbionts, including human microbiota, can be transmitted both vertically and horizontally. Mixed-mode transmission can allow symbionts to have the “best of both worlds” – they can vertically infect host offspring when host density is low, and horizontally infect diverse additional hosts when a number of additional hosts are available. Mixed-mode transmission make the outcome (degree of harm or benefit) of the relationship more difficult to predict, because the evolutionary success of the symbiont is sometimes but not always tied to the success of the host.[21]

7,Symptoms of COVID-19,"




Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.[1][2] Common symptoms include headache,[3] loss of smell[4] and taste,[5] nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever,[6] diarrhea, and breathing difficulties.[7] People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.[7] In people without prior ear, nose, and throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19.[8]
Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) and 5% of patients suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[9] At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[10][11][12][13] These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can spread the disease.[13][14][15][16] Other infected people will develop symptoms later, called ""pre-symptomatic"", or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.[16]
As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. The median delay for COVID-19 is four to five days.[17] Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.[17][18]
Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease. However, some people continue to experience a range of effects for months after recovery—named long COVID—and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.[19]
Some symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and fatigue.[1][20] Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty in breathing. Emergency symptoms include difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.[1] Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.
Some symptoms usually appear sooner than others. In August 2020, scientists at the University of Southern California reported the ""likely"" order of initial symptoms of the COVID-19 disease as a fever followed by a cough and muscle pain, and that nausea and vomiting usually appear before diarrhea.[21] This contrasts with the most common path for influenza where it is common to develop a cough first and fever later.[21] While health agency guidelines tend to recommend isolating for 14 days while watching for symptoms to develop,[22] there is limited evidence that symptoms may develop for some patients more than 14 days after initial exposure.[23]
Typical systemic symptoms include fatigue, and muscle and joint pains. Some people have a sore throat.[1][2][20]
Fever is one of the most common symptoms in COVID-19 patients. However, its absence at an initial screening does not rule out COVID-19. Fever in the first week of a COVID-19 infection is part of the body's natural immune response; however, if the infections develop into a cytokine storm the fever is counterproductive. As of September 2020, little research had focused on relating fever intensity to outcomes.[24]
A June 2020 systematic review reported a 75–81% prevalence of fever.[2] As of July 2020, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported a prevalence rate of ~45% for fever.[7]
A June 2020 systematic review reported a 27–35% prevalence of fatigue, 14–19% for muscle pain, 10–14% for sore throat.[2] As of July 2020, the ECDC reported a prevalence rate of ~63% for muscle weakness (asthenia), ~63% for muscle pain (myalgia), and ~53% for sore throat.[7]
Cough is another typical symptom of COVID-19, which could be either dry or a productive cough.[2]
Some symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, are more common in patients who need hospital care.[1] Shortness of breath tends to develop later in the illness.
Respiratory complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).[25][26][27][28]
As of July 2020, the ECDC reported a prevalence rate of ~68% for nasal obstruction, ~63% for cough, ~60% for rhinorrhoea.[7] A June 2020 systematic review reported a 54–61% prevalence of dry cough and 22–28% for productive cough.[2]
Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias, heart inflammation, and blood clots.[29][30][31][32][33]
Patients with COVID-19 can present with neurological symptoms that can be broadly divided into central nervous system involvement, such as headache, dizziness, altered mental state, and disorientation, and peripheral nervous system involvement, such as anosmia and dysgeusia.[34] Some patients experience cognitive dysfunction called ""COVID fog"", or ""COVID brain fog"", involving memory loss, inattention, poor concentration or disorientation.[35][36] Other neurologic manifestations include seizures, strokes, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (which includes loss of motor functions).[37][38]
As of July 2020, the ECDC reported a prevalence rate of ~70% for headache.[7] A June 2020 systematic review reported a 10–16% prevalence of headache.[2]
In some people, COVID-19 causes people to temporarily lose their sense of smell.[39][40]
This symptom, if it is present at all, often appears early in the illness.[39] Its onset is often reported to be sudden. Smell usually returns to normal within a month. However, for some patients it improves very slowly and is associated with odors being perceived as unpleasant or different than they originally did (parosmia), and for some people smell does not return for at least many months.[40] It is an unusual symptom for other respiratory diseases, so it is used for symptom-based screening.[39][40]
Loss of smell has several consequences. Loss of smell increases foodborne illness due to inability to detect spoiled food, and may increase fire hazards due to inability to detect smoke. It has also been linked to depression. If smell does not return, smell training is a potential option.[40]
It is sometimes the only symptom to be reported, implying that it has a neurological basis separate from nasal congestion. As of January 2021, it is believed that these symptoms are caused by infection of sustentacular cells that support and provide nutrients to sensory neurons in the nose, rather than infection of the neurons themselves. Sustentacular cells have many ACE2 receptors on their surfaces, while olfactory sensory neurons do not. Loss of smell may also be the result of inflammation in the olfactory bulb.[40]
A June 2020 systematic review found a 29–54% prevalence of olfactory dysfunction for people with COVID-19,[39] while an August 2020 study using a smell-identification test reported that 96% of people with COVID-19 had some olfactory dysfunction, and 18% had total smell loss.[40] Another June 2020 systematic review reported a 4–55% prevalence of hyposmia.[2] As of July 2020, the ECDC reported a prevalence rate of ~70% for loss of smell.[7]
A disturbance in smell or taste is more commonly found in younger people, and perhaps because of this, it is correlated with a lower risk of medical complications.[39]
In some people, COVID-19 causes people to temporarily experience changes in how food tastes (dysgeusia or ageusia).[39][40] Changes to chemesthesis, which includes chemically triggered sensations such as spiciness, are also reported. As of January 2021, the mechanism for taste and chemesthesis symptoms were not well understood.[40]
A June 2020 systematic review found a 24–54% prevalence of gustatory dysfunction for people with COVID-19.[39] Another June 2020 systematic review reported a 1–8% prevalence of hypogeusia.[2] As of July 2020, the ECDC reported a prevalence rate of ~54% for gustatory dysfunction.[7]
Other neurological symptoms appear to be rare, but may affect half of patients who are hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Some reported symptoms include delirium, stroke, brain hemorrhage, memory loss, psychosis, peripheral nerve damage, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Neurological symptoms in many cases are correlated with damage to the brain's blood supply or encephalitis, which can progress in some cases to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Strokes have been reported in younger people without conventional risk factors.[41]
As of September 2020, it was unclear whether these symptoms were due to direct infection of brain cells, or of overstimulation of the immune system.[41]
A June 2020 systematic review reported a 6–16% prevalence of vertigo or dizziness, 7–15% for confusion, and 0–2% for ataxia.[2]
Other symptoms are less common among people with COVID-19. Some people experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.[1][42] A June 2020 systematic review reported a 8–12% prevalence of diarrhea, and 3–10% for nausea.[2]
Less common symptoms include chills, coughing out blood, diarrhea, and rash.[20] The so-called ""COVID toes"" are pink to violaceous papules arising on the hands and feet. These chilblain-like lesions often occur only in younger patients and do not appear until late in the disease or during convalescence.[43] Certain genetic polymorphisms (in the TREX1 gene) have been linked to susceptibility towards developing COVID-toe.[44] A June 2020 systematic review reported a 0–1% prevalence of rash in COVID-19 patients.[2]
Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury.[45][46]
Complications include multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death.[25][26][27][28]
Following the infection, children may develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, also called paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. This has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.[47][48][49]
Some early studies suggest that ten to twenty percent of people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.[50][51] A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems, including fatigue and shortness of breath.[52] About 5-10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.[53]
By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID-19.[54] The majority of CT scans performed show lung abnormalities in people tested after 28 days of illness.[55]

8,COVID-19 testing,"




Vaccines (deployment)

COVID-19 testing involves analyzing samples to assess the current or past presence of SARS-CoV-2. The two main branches detect either the presence of the virus or of antibodies produced in response to infection.[1][2] Molecular tests for viral presence through its molecular components are used to diagnose individual cases and to allow public health authorities to trace and contain outbreaks. Antibody tests (serology immunoassays) instead show whether someone once had the disease.[3] They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection.[4] It is used to assess disease prevalence, which aids the estimation of the infection fatality rate.[5]
Individual jurisdictions have adopted varied testing protocols, including whom to test, how often to test, analysis protocols, sample collection and the uses of test results.[6][7][8] This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics.[9][10][11][12] Because SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs days after exposure (and before onset of symptoms) there is an urgent need for frequent surveillance and rapid availability of results.[13]
Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Alternatively, point-of-care testing can be done in physician's offices and parking lots, workplaces, institutional settings or transit hubs.
Positive viral tests indicate a current infection, while positive antibody tests indicate a prior infection.[15] Other techniques include a CT scan, checking for elevated body temperature, checking for low blood oxygen level, and the deployment of detection dogs at airports.[16][17][18]
Detection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus' inner DNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. Tests that look for the viral antigens (parts of the virus) are called antigen tests.
There are multiple types of tests that look for the virus by detecting the presence of the virus's DNA. These are called molecular tests, after molecular biology. As of 2021, the most common form of molecular test is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.[19] Other methods used in molecular tests include CRISPR, isothermal nucleic acid amplification, digital polymerase chain reaction, microarray analysis, and next-generation sequencing.[19]
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a process that amplifies (replicates) a small, well-defined segment of DNA many hundreds of thousands of times, creating enough of it for analysis. Test samples are treated with certain chemicals[20][21] that allow DNA to be extracted. Reverse transcription converts RNA into DNA.
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) first uses reverse transcription to obtain DNA, followed by PCR to amplify that DNA, creating enough to be analyzed.[21] RT-PCR can thereby detect SARS-CoV-2, which contains only RNA. The RT-PCR process generally requires a few hours.[22] These tests are also referred to as molecular or genetic assays.[3]
Real-time PCR (qPCR)[23] provides advantages including automation, higher-throughput and more reliable instrumentation. It has become the preferred method.[24][25]
The combined technique has been described as real-time RT-PCR[26] or quantitative RT-PCR[27] and is sometimes abbreviated qRT-PCR,[28] rRT-PCR[29] or RT-qPCR,[30] although sometimes RT-PCR or PCR are used. The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines propose the term RT-qPCR,[31] but not all authors adhere to this.
Average sensitivity for rapid molecular tests depend on the brand. For ID NOW, the average sensitivity was 73.0% with an average specificity of 99.7%; for Xpert Xpress the average sensitivity was 100% with an average specificity of 97.2%.[32] The term sensitivity refers to the capacity of a test to identify all infected people, while specificity is the ability of a test to detect a particular virus.[3]
Samples can be obtained by various methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab, sputum (coughed up material),[33] throat swabs,[34] deep airway material collected via suction catheter[34] or saliva.[35][36] Drosten et al. remarked that for 2003 SARS, ""from a diagnostic point of view, it is important to note that nasal and throat swabs seem less suitable for diagnosis, since these materials contain considerably less viral RNA than sputum, and the virus may escape detection if only these materials are tested.""[37]
Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage.[38]
The likelihood of detecting the virus depends on collection method and how much time has passed since infection. According to Drosten tests performed with throat swabs are reliable only in the first week. Thereafter the virus may abandon the throat and multiply in the lungs. In the second week, sputum or deep airways collection is preferred.[34]
Collecting saliva may be as effective as nasal and throat swabs,[35] although this is not certain.[39][36] Sampling saliva may reduce the risk for health care professionals by eliminating close physical interaction.[40] It is also more comfortable for the patient.[41] Quarantined people can collect their own samples.[40] A saliva test's diagnostic value depends on sample site (deep throat, oral cavity, or salivary glands).[36] Some studies have found that saliva yielded greater sensitivity and consistency when compared with swab samples.[42][43][44]
On 15 August 2020, the US FDA granted an emergency use authorization for a saliva test developed at Yale University that gives results in hours.[45][46]
On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test.[47]
Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset.[48]

Isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. They are faster than PCR because they don't involve repeated heating and cooling cycles. These tests typically detect DNA using fluorescent tags, which are read out with specialized machines.
CRISPR gene editing technology was modified to perform the detection: if the CRISPR enzyme attaches to the sequence, it colors a paper strip. The researchers expect the resulting test to be cheap and easy to use in point-of-care settings.[49][50] The test amplifies RNA directly, without the RNA-to-DNA conversion step of RT-PCR.[51]
An antigen is the part of a pathogen that elicits an immune response. Antigen tests look for antigen proteins from the viral surface. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes.[52] SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be detected before onset of COVID-19 symptoms (as soon as SARS-CoV-2 virus particles) with more rapid test results, but with less sensitivity than PCR tests for the virus.[53]
Antigen tests may be one way to scale up testing to much greater levels.[52] Isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests can process only one sample at a time per machine. RT-PCR tests are accurate but require too much time, energy and trained personnel to run the tests.[52] ""There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,"" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. ""But there might be with the antigen test.""[54]
Samples may be collected via nasopharyngeal swab, a swab of the anterior nares, or from saliva. The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. Antigens bind to the strips and give a visual readout. The process takes less than 30 minutes, can deliver results at point of care, and does not require expensive equipment or extensive training.[52]
Swabs of respiratory viruses often lack enough antigen material to be detectable.[55] This is especially true for asymptomatic patients who have little if any nasal discharge. Viral proteins are not amplified in an antigen test.[52][56] According to the WHO the sensitivity of similar antigen tests for respiratory diseases like the flu ranges between 34% and 80%. ""Based on this information, half or more of COVID-19 infected patients might be missed by such tests, depending on the group of patients tested,"" the WHO said. While some scientists doubt whether an antigen test can be useful against COVID-19,[56] others have argued that antigen tests are highly sensitive when viral load is high and people are contagious, making them suitable for public health screening.[57][58] Routine antigen tests can quickly identify when asymptomatic people are contagious, while follow-up PCR can be used if confirmatory diagnosis is needed.[59]
The average sensitivity of antigen tests varies between brands, from 34.1% for Coris Bioconcept to 88.1% for SD Biosensor STANDARD Q. Average specificities were high for most brands with an average of 99.6%.[32]
Sudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water.[60] Because various conditions can lead to the loss of the sense of smell, a sniff test would not be definitive but indicate the need for a PCR test. Because the loss of the sense of smell shows up before other symptoms, there has been a call for widespread sniff testing. Health care bureaucracies have generally ignored sniff tests even though they are quick, easy and capable of being self-administered daily. This has led some medical journals to write editorials supporting the adoption of sniff testing.[61]
Typical visible features on CT initially include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral or posterior distribution.[62] COVID-19 can be identified with higher precision using CT than with RT-PCR.[63]
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation may develop as the disease evolves.[62][64] Chest CT scans and chest x-rays are not recommended for diagnosing COVID-19. Radiologic findings in COVID-19 lack specificity.[62][65]
The body responds to a viral infection by producing antibodies that help neutralize the virus. Blood tests (also called serology tests or serology immunoassays[3]) can detect the presence of such antibodies.[66] Antibody tests can be used to assess what fraction of a population has once been infected, which can then be used to calculate the disease's mortality rate.[5] They can also be used to determine how much antibody is contained in a unit of convalescent plasma, for COVID-19 treatment, or to verify if a given vaccine generates an adequate immune response.[67]
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies' potency and protective period have not been established.[5][68] Therefore, a positive antibody test may not imply immunity to a future infection. Further, whether mild or asymptomatic infections produce sufficient antibodies for a test to detect has not been established.[69] Antibodies for some diseases persist in the bloodstream for many years, while others fade away.[52]
The most notable antibodies are IgM and IgG. IgM antibodies are generally detectable several days after initial infection, although levels over the course of infection and beyond are not well characterized.[70] IgG antibodies generally become detectable 10–14 days after infection and normally peak around 28 days after infection.[71][72] This pattern of antibody development seen with other infections, often does not apply to SARS-CoV-2, however, with IgM sometimes occurring after IgG, together with IgG or not occurring at all.[73] Generally, however, median IgM detection occurs 5 days after symptom onset, whereas IgG is detected a median 14 days after symptom onset.[74] IgG levels significantly decline after two or three months.[75]
Genetic tests verify infection earlier than antibody tests. Only 30% of those with a positive genetic test produced a positive antibody test on day 7 of their infection.[69]
RDTs typically use a small, portable, positive/negative lateral flow assay that can be executed at point of care. RDTs may process blood samples, saliva samples, or nasal swab fluids. RDTs produce colored lines to indicate positive or negative results.[76]
ELISAs can be qualitative or quantitative and generally require a lab. These tests usually use whole blood, plasma, or serum samples. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Samples are incubated with the protein, allowing any antibodies to bind to it. The antibody-protein complex can then be detected with another wash of antibodies that produce a color/fluorescent readout.[76]
Neutralization assays assess whether sample antibodies prevent viral infection in test cells. These tests sample blood, plasma or serum. The test cultures cells that allow viral reproduction (e.g., VeroE6 cells). By varying antibody concentrations, researchers can visualize and quantify how many test antibodies block virus replication.[76]
Chemiluminescent immunoassays are quantitative lab tests. They sample blood, plasma, or serum. Samples are mixed with a known viral protein, buffer reagents and specific, enzyme-labeled antibodies. The result is luminescent. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay uses magnetic, protein-coated microparticles. Antibodies react to the viral protein, forming a complex. Secondary enzyme-labeled antibodies are added and bind to these complexes. The resulting chemical reaction produces light. The radiance is used to calculate the number of antibodies. This test can identify multiple types of antibodies, including IgG, IgM, and IgA.[76]
Most if not all large scale COVID-19 antibody testing looks for binding antibodies only and does not measure the more important neutralizing antibodies (NAb).[77][78][79] A NAb is an antibody that defends a cell from an infectious particle by neutralizing its biological effects. Neutralization renders the particle no longer infectious or pathogenic.[80] A binding antibody binds to the pathogen but the pathogen remains infective; the purpose can be to flag the pathogen for destruction by the immune system.[81] It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages.[82] Since most COVID-19 antibody tests return a positive result if they find only binding antibodies, these tests cannot indicate that the subject has generated protective NAbs that protect against re-infection.[78][79]
It is expected that binding antibodies imply the presence of NAbs[79] and for many viral diseases total antibody responses correlate somewhat with NAb responses[83] but this is not established for COVID-19. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. How these patients recovered without the help of NAbs and whether they were at risk of re-infection was not addressed.[78] An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses.[77]
Studies have indicated that NAbs to the original SARS virus (the predecessor to the current SARS-CoV-2) can remain active for two years[84] and are gone after six years.[85] Nevertheless, memory cells including Memory B cells and Memory T cells[86] can last much longer and may have the ability to reduce reinfection severity.[85]
A point of care test in Peru. A blood droplet is collected by a pipette.
Blood from pipette is then placed onto a COVID-19 rapid diagnostic test device.
The rapid diagnostic test shows reactions of IgG and IgM antibodies.
Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Among those who do, RNA concentrations three days following recovery are generally below the range in which replication-competent virus has been reliably isolated.[87]
No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens.[88]
Pooled testing can improve turnaround time, by combining a number of samples to be tested together. If the pool result is negative, all samples are negative. If the test result is positive, samples will need to be individually tested.[67]
In January 2020, scientists from China published the first genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 via GISAID, a program that normally handled genetic sequence data.[90][91] Researchers around the world used that data to build molecular tests for the virus. Antigen- and antibody-based tests were developed later.[citation needed]
Even once the first tests were created, the supply was limited. As a result, no countries had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus early in the pandemic.[92] The WHO and other experts called for ramping up testing as the best way to slow the spread of the virus.[93][94] Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US.[95][96][97] Early tests also encountered problems with reliability.[98][99]
In drive-through testing, the person undergoing testing remains in a vehicle while a healthcare professional approaches the vehicle and obtains a sample, all while taking appropriate precautions such as wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).[100][101] Drive-through centers helped South Korea accelerate its testing program.[102]
In Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. They spit into it, return it and later get the result.[103]
In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive.[104][105][106] Pool testing was then adopted in Israel, Germany, Ghana[107][108][109] South Korea,[110] Nebraska,[111] China[112] and the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh,[113] West Bengal,[114] Punjab,[115] Chhattisgarh[116] and Maharashtra.[117]
Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays.[118] These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers.
One study proposed a rapid immune response assay as a screening test, with a confirmatory nucleic acid test for diagnosis, followed by a rapid antibody test to determine course of action and assess population exposure/herd immunity.[119]
Required testing levels are a function of disease spread. The more the cases, the more tests are needed to manage the outbreak. COVID-19 tends to grow exponentially at the beginning of an outbreak, meaning that the number of required tests initially also grows exponentially. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained.
WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction.[120]
Economist Paul Romer reported that the US has the technical capacity to scale up to 20 million tests per day, which is his estimate of the scale needed to fully remobilize the economy.[122] The Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics estimated on 4 April that this capacity could be available by late July.[123] Romer pointed to single-molecule real-time sequencing equipment from Pacific Biosciences[122][124] and to the Ion Torrent Next-Generation Sequencing equipment from ThermoFisher Scientific.[122][125] According to Romer, ""Recent research papers suggest that any one of these has the potential to scale up to millions of tests per day."" This plan requires removing regulatory hurdles. Romer estimated that $100 billion would cover the costs.[122]
Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. The average person would be tested roughly every two weeks. Those who tested positive would go into quarantine. Romer's simulation indicated that the fraction of the population that is infected at any given time (known as the attack rate) peaks reaches roughly 8% in about thirty days before gradually declining, in most runs reaching zero at 500 days, with cumulative prevalence remaining below 20%.[126]
A study found that, despite possibly suboptimal implementation, the snapshot mass-testing approach conducted by Slovakia by which ~80% of its population was tested for COVID-19 within a weekend at the end of October 2020 was highly efficacious, decreasing observed prevalence by 58% within one week and by 70% compared to a hypothetical scenario of no snapshot mass-testing.[127][128] The significant reduction resulted from a set of complementary lockdown and quarantine measures whereby citizens who tested positive were quarantined synchronously the weeks afterwards.[129]
Countries around the world developed tests independently and in partnership with others.
Tests developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the US targeted different parts of the viral genome. WHO adopted the German system for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own.[citation needed]
PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the ""E"" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.[130]
Abbott Laboratories' ID Now nucleic acid test uses isothermal amplification technology.[131] The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with ""fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons"".[132] The test kit uses the company's ""toaster-size"" ID Now device, which is widely deployed in the US.[133] The device can be used in laboratories or in point of care settings, and provides results in 13 minutes or less.[132]
Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. They are offered by the United Nations and other procurement agencies.
Quidel's ""Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIA""[59][134] is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein.[135] The result is read out by the company's Sofia 2 device using immunofluorescence.[135] The test is simpler and cheaper but less accurate than nucleic acid tests. It can be deployed in laboratories or at point of care and gives results in 15 minutes.[134] A false negative result occurs if the sample's antigen level is positive but below the test's detection limit, requiring confirmation with a nucleic acid test.[135]
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the infection. Multiple jurisdictions survey their populations using these tests.[136][137] The test requires a blood sample.
Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request.[138]
Antibody tests are available in various European countries.[139] Quotient Limited developed a CE marked COVID-19 antibody test.[140][141][142]
Roche offers a selective ELISA serology test.[143]
A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some ""serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]"", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, ""caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance"". The review called for higher quality studies assessing accuracy with reference to a standard of ""RT-PCR performed on at least two consecutive specimens, and, when feasible, includ[ing] viral cultures.""[144][145] CEBM researchers have called for in-hospital 'case definition' to record ""CT lung findings and associated blood tests""[146] and for the WHO to produce a ""protocol to standardise the use and interpretation of PCR"" with continuous re-calibration.[147]
The standard blood test (quick scan) taken at the emergency room measures different values. By use of the blood quick scan the CoLab score is calculated with a developed algorithm based on how the coronavirus causes changes in the blood. The software is intended for use in emergency rooms to quickly rule out the presence of the disease in incoming patients. A not negative result is followed by a PCR or LAMP test.[148]
The breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. A not negative result is followed by a PCR or LAMP test.
In May 2021, Reuters reported that Dutch researchers at Wageningen University had shown that trained bees could detect the virus in infected samples in seconds and this could benefit countries where test facilities are in short supply. [149] A two month study by the Necker-Cochin hospital Paris in conjunction with the French national veterinary school also found that dogs were more reliable than current lateral flow tests according to the Guardian.[150]
Accuracy is measured in terms of specificity and selectivity. Test errors can be false positives (the test is positive, but the virus is not present) or false negatives, (the test is negative, but the virus is present).[152]
Sensitivity indicates whether the test accurately identifies whether the virus is present. Each test requires a minimum level of viral load in order to produce a positive result. A 90% sensitive test will correctly identify 90% of infections, missing the other 10% (a false negative). Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates.[152]
Specificity indicates how well-targeted the test is to the virus in question. Highly specific tests pick up only the virus in question. Non-selective tests pick up other viruses as well. A 90% specific test will correctly identify 90% of those who are uninfected, leaving 10% with a false positive result.[152]
Low-specificity tests have a low positive predictive value (PPV) when prevalence is low. For example, suppose incidence is 5%. Testing 100 people at random using a test that has a specificity of 95% would yield on average 5 people who are actually negative who would incorrectly test positive. Since 5% of the subjects actually are positive, another five would also test positive correctly, totaling 10 positive results. Thus, the PPV is 50%,[153] an outcome no different from a coin toss. In this situation retesting those with a positive result increases the PPV to 94.5%, meaning that only 4.5% of the second tests would return the incorrect result, on average less than 1 incorrect result.[154]
The time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. Samples may be collected before the virus has had a chance to establish itself or after the body has begun to eliminate it. A May 2020 review of PCR-RT testing found that the median probability of a false-negative result decreased from 100% on day 1, to 67% on day 4. On the day of symptom onset, the probability was 38%, which decreased to 20% 3 days later.[155][needs update]
RT-PCR is the most commonly-used diagnostic test.[156] It typically has high sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting: however, in one study sensitivity dropped to 66–88% clinically.[157]
In one study sensitivity was highest at week one (100%), followed by 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4% and zero by week six.[158][159]
Sensitivity is also a function of the number of PCR cycles, as well as time and temperature between sample collection and analysis.[160] A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person.[160] Cycle thresholds above 34 are increasingly likely to give false positives outside of high biosafety level facilities.[160]
A Dutch CDC-led laboratory investigation compared 7 PCR kits.[161] Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity.[162]
High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients.[161]
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence[163][164] that ""a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with"", and have called for ""an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing"".[165] On 7 September, the UK government issued ""guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results"".[166]
On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test.[47]
One study reported that the ID Now COVID-19 test showed sensitivity of 85.2%. Abbott responded that the issue could have been caused by analysis delays.[167] Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity.[168]
The WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.[169][170] Out of the sixteen reference laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.[171]
Iceland managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with less aggressive lock-downs.[172]
Researchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. They tested about 3,400 people twice, at an interval of ten days. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. All discovered cases were quarantined. Along with restricting travel to the commune, new infections were completely eliminated.[173]
Unlike other Asian countries, Japan did not experience a pandemic of SARS or MERS, so the country's PCR testing system was not well developed.[174][175] Japan preferentially tested patients with severe illness and their close contacts at the beginning. Japan's Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting chose cluster measures to identify infections clusters.[174][175] The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them.[175][176]
In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Only administrative tests were carried out at first, until insurance began covering PCR tests on 6 March. Private companies began to test, and the test system gradually expanded.[174][177]
On 3 April, those with positive tests were legally permitted to recuperate at home or in a hotel if they had asymptomatic or mild illness, ending the hospital bed shortage.[178] The first wave (from China) was contained,[179] but a second wave (caused by returnees from Europe and the US) in mid-March led to spreading infection in April.[175] On 7 April, Japan declared a state of emergency, (less strict than a lockdown, because it did not block cities or restrict outings).[175][178][180] On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for diagnosis.[181][182]
Japan's PCR test count per capita remained far smaller than in some other countries even though its positive test rate was lower. Excess mortality was observed in March.[176][failed verification][180][failed verification][183] The Expert Meeting stated, ""The Japanese health care system originally carries out pneumonia surveillance, allowing it to detect most of the severely ill patients who develop pneumonia. There are a large number of CT scanners in Japan and they have spread to small hospitals all over the country, so pneumonia patients are rarely missed. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.""[176][183] The group recommended using CT scans data and doctor's findings for diagnosis.[184][185] On the Diamond Princess cruise ship, many people who initially tested negative later tested positive. Half of coronavirus-positives there who remained mild or asymptomatic had pneumonia findings on CT scans and their CT image showed a frosted glass shadow that is characteristic of infection.[184][186]
As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. When the antigen test is added to it, the number is about 58,000. The number of tests per 1,000 people in the United States is about 27 times that of Japan, the UK is 20 times, Italy is 8 times, and South Korea is twice (as of 26 July).[187][188][189] The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. This is thought to be due to the proper testing of those infected in July compared to those in April. In April, the number of tests could not catch up with the increase in the number of infected people, and the test standards were strict, so the test positive rate exceeded 30% at the peak. It means that there were quite a few cases where the those infected was not PCR tested. It is thought that the severe case was preferentially tested though there were a lot of mild cases and asymptomatic carriers mainly in the young during the first wave. In other words, it became possible to grasp the actual situation of infection much better than before by strengthening the testing system.[190] At the end of July, accommodation facilities for mild and asymptomatic carriers became full, and the authorities requested hospitals to prepare beds for the mild. However, it became difficult to treat patients with other illnesses and to maintain the ICU system including the staff due to the occupation of hospital beds by patients with mild symptoms.[191][192][193]
On 27 April 2020, Russia tested 3 million people and had 183,000 positive results.[194] On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. Illness improved from six days to one day after symptoms appeared. Antibody testing was carried out on 3,200 Moscow doctors, finding 20% immunity.[195]
With contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, Singapore arrested the initial spread without complete lockdown.[196]
In late October 2020 Slovakia tested 3.62 million people in a weekend, from a population of 5.4m, representing 67% of the total (or 82% of the adult population), 38,359 tested positive, representing 1.06% of those tested. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date.[197]
South Korea's broad testing approach helped reduce spread. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s.[198]
The government exploited the resident registration number (RRN) system. Authorities mobilized young men who were eligible for military service as social service agents, security and public health doctors. Public health doctors were mainly dispatched to public health centers and life treatment centers where mildly ill patients were accommodated. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Social service agents worked in pharmacies to fill staff shortages. Korea's 10k PCR tests per million residents was the world's highest as of 13 April rising to 20k by mid-June. Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. Korean authorities set up a treatment center to isolate and manage patients with asymptomatic and minor illnesses in one facility in order to vacate hospital beds for the more severely ill.
Centers were sited mainly at national facilities and corporate training centers. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Then President Park Geun-hye allowed Korean CDC-approved private sector testing for infectious diseases in 2016. Korea already had a system for isolating, testing and treating infectious disease patients separately from others. Patients with respiratory illness but no epidemiological relevance were treated at the National Hospital, and those with epidemiological relevance were treated at selected clinics.[199][200][201][202][203][204][205][206][207]
Korea established a large scale drive-through/walk-through"" test testing program. However, the most common method was ""mobile examination"". In Daegu City, 54% of samples were collected by 23 March in home or hospital. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. Korea solved the problem by drafting more than 2,700 public insurance doctors.[199][203][202]
The government disclosed personal information to the public via KCDC without patient consent. The authorities used digital surveillance to trace possible spread.[200][203][204][206][207][208][209][210][211][212]
Health insurance IDs and national identification card numbers were used to trace contacts.[213][214][215][216]
In January 2021, the COVID-19 testing results of the UAE came under scrutiny, as Denmark suspended the Emirati flights for five days. The European nation said that it barred the flights from the UAE due to growing suspicion of irregularities in the testing process being followed in the Gulf nation. Denmark's Minister of Transport, Benny Engelbrecht said that they were taking time to ensure that the negative tests of travelers from the Emirates were a real screening carried out appropriately.[217]
New York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. They managed to convince the CDC to approve tests at state laboratories and the FDA to approve a test kit. As of 13 March the state was conducting more than 1,000 daily tests, growing to 10,000/day on 19 March. In April, the number exceeded 20,000. Many people queued at hospitals to get tested. On 21 March New York City health officials directed medical providers to test only those entering the hospital, for lack of PPE.[206][218][219][220][221]
Following an outbreak, 94% of the 4,800 aircraft carrier crew were tested. Roughly 60 percent of the 600-plus sailors who tested positive were asymptomatic.[222] Five infected sailors who completed quarantine subsequently developed flu-like symptoms and again tested positive.[223]
A shortage of trained medical laboratory scientists, assay reagents, analyzers, transport medium, and PPE coupled with high demand had limited initially limited the availability of testing and led to significantly increased turnaround times.[citation needed]
Testing strategies vary by country and over time,[224] with some countries testing very widely,[8] while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill.[6] The country that tests only people showing symptoms will have a higher figure for ""Confirmed / tested"" than the country that also tests others.[225] If two countries are alike in every respect, including which people they test, the one that tests more people will have a higher ""Confirmed / population"". Studies have also found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have lower estimated case fatality rates[9] and younger age distributions of cases.[11]

9,Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19,"




Hazard controls for COVID-19 in workplaces are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for hazard controls to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The proper hazard controls in the workplace depend on the worksite and job task, based on an occupational risk assessment of sources of exposure, disease severity in the community, and risk factors of individual workers who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel. This includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-population-density work environments, and some high-volume retail settings. Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneeze guards, and having personal protective equipment available in case a person with COVID-19 is encountered.
OSHA considers healthcare and mortuary workers exposed to known or suspected person with COVID-19 to be at high exposure risk, which increases to very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected person with COVID-19. Hazard controls appropriate for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects within the workplace. Workers may be absent from work due to becoming sick, needing to care for others, or from fear of possible exposure. Patterns of commerce may change, both in terms of what goods are demanded, and the means of acquiring these goods (such as shopping at off-peak hours or through delivery or drive-through services). Lastly, shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted.[1]:6
An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide protective actions. Such plans address the levels of risk associated with various worksites and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors of individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions. They also outline controls necessary to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks. Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.[1]:7–8 Objectives for response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people who are at higher risk for adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains. The disease severity in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken.[2]
It has been suggested that improving ventilation and managing exposure duration can reduce transmission.[3][4]
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard controls by effectiveness. Where COVID-19 hazards cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and lastly personal protective equipment. Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement. Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures. All types of PPE must be selected based upon the hazard to the worker, properly fitted as applicable (e.g., respirators), consistently and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.[1]:12–16 Randomized controlled trials and simulation studies are needed to determine the most effective types of PPE for preventing the transmission of infectious diseases to healthcare workers. There is low quality evidence that supports making improvements or modifications to personal protective equipment in order to help decrease contamination. Examples of modifications include adding tabs to masks or gloves to ease removal and designing protective gowns so that gloves are removed at the same time. In addition, there is weak evidence that the following PPE approaches or techniques may lead to reduced contamination and improved compliance with PPE protocols: Wearing double gloves, following specific doffing (removal) procedures such as those from the CDC, and providing people with spoken instructions while removing PPE.[6]
In many workplaces, groups share many hours of the day indoors. These conditions can facilitate the transmission of disease,[7] but also control it through workplace practices and policies.[8] Identifying industries or particular jobs that have the highest potential exposure to a specific risk can help in the development of interventions to control or prevent the spread of diseases such as COVID-19.[9][10][11]
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers.[1]:18–20 Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette including covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissues and trash receptacles, preparing for telecommuting or staggered shifts if needed, discouraging workers from using others' tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment. Prompt identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at a worksite.[1]:8–9 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are to stay home until they are free of fever, signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines, and that sick leave policies are flexible, permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of these policies.[2]
There are also psychosocial hazards arising from anxiety or stress from worries about contracting COVID-19, the illness or death of a relative or friend, changes in work patterns, and financial or interpersonal difficulties arising from the pandemic. Social distancing measures may prevent typical coping mechanisms such as personal space or sharing problems with others. Controls for these hazards include managers checking on workers to ask how they are, facilitating worker interactions, and formal services for employee assistance, coaching, or occupational health.[12]
It has been suggested that improving ventilation and managing exposure duration can reduce transmission.[3][4]
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are not known or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business location, or because the individual has recent international travel to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission. These include workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-population-density work environments, and some high-volume retail settings.[1]:18–20
Engineering controls for this and higher risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as clear plastic sneeze guards, and installing a drive-through window for customer service.[1]:12–13
Administrative controls for this and higher risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing staggered shifts, discontinuing nonessential travel to locations with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, developing emergency communications plans including a forum for answering workers’ concerns, providing workers with up-to-date education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviors, training workers who need to use protecting clothing and equipment how to use it, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, requiring regular hand washing, limiting customers' and the public's access to the worksite, and posting signage about hand washing and other COVID-19 protective measures.[1]:13–14, 21–22
Depending on the work task, workers with at least medium exposure risk may need to wear personal protective equipment including some combination of gloves, a gown, a face shield or face mask, or goggles. Workers in this risk group rarely require use of respirators.[1]:22
For retail workers in food and grocery businesses, CDC and OSHA recommend specific COVID-19 hazard controls above the general workplace practices. For employees, these include encouraging touchless payment options and minimizing handling of cash and credit cards, placing cash on the counter rather than passing it directly by hand, and routinely disinfecting frequently touched surfaces such as workstations, cash registers, payment terminals, door handles, tables, and countertops. Employers may place sneeze guards with a pass-through opening at the bottom of the barrier in checkout and customer service locations, use every other check-out lane, move the electronic payment terminal farther from the cashier, place visual cues such as floor decals to indicate where customers should stand during check out, provide remote shopping alternatives, and limit the maximum customer capacity at the door.[13]
Meat and poultry processing facilities are considered critical infrastructure workers, and CDC advises that they may be permitted to continue work following potential exposure to COVID-19, provided they remain asymptomatic and additional precautions are implemented to protect them and the community. However, their work environments may contribute substantially to their potential exposures, as they often work close to one another on processing lines during prolonged work shifts. For engineering controls, CDC and OSHA recommend configuring communal work environments so that workers are spaced at least six feet apart including along processing lines, using physical barriers such as strip curtains or plexiglass to separate workers from each other, and ensuring adequate ventilation that minimizes air from fans blowing from one worker directly at another worker. For administrative controls, they recommend staggering workers' arrival, break, and departure times, cohorting workers so they are always assigned to the same shifts with the same coworkers, encouraging single-file movement through the facility, avoiding carpooling to and from work, and considering a program of screening workers before entry into the workplace and setting criteria for return to work of recovered workers and for exclusion of sick workers. For personal protective equipment, they recommend face shields and considering allowing voluntary use of filtering facepiece respirators such as N95 masks. They also recommend wearing cloth face masks that should be replaced if they become wet, soiled, or otherwise visibly contaminated during the work shift, although cloth face masks are not considered to be personal protective equipment.[14]
If a person becomes sick on an airplane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, designating one crew member to serve the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing. Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when tending to a sick traveler or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing. Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.[15]
For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include postponing travel when sick, and self-isolating and informing the onboard medical center immediately if one develops a fever or other symptoms while on board. Ideally, medical follow-up should occur in the isolated person's cabin.[16]
For schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of community spread. When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as canceling field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between desks, staggering arrival and dismissal times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms. When there is substantial transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school dismissals may be considered.[17]
For law enforcement personnel performing daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by CDC. Law enforcement officials who must make contact with individuals confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment. If close contact occurs during apprehension, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belt and gear prior to reuse using a household cleaning spray or wipe, and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and for containing and laundering clothes.[18]
OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary workers to be at high or very high categories of exposure risk. High exposure risk jobs include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients. These become very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients. Aerosol-generating procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and exams, or invasive specimen collection. High exposure risk mortuary jobs include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people who had known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high exposure risk if they perform an autopsy.[1]:18–20
Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, including when aerosol-generating procedures are performed. Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and mortuary settings. Specimens should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.[1]:13, 23–24 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case.[19]
In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of patients known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those performing aerosol-generating procedures. In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training, and medical exams. Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.[1]:14–16, 25
The WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through bodily fluids.[19][20] WHO recommends only a surgical mask for point-of-entry screening personnel. For those who are collecting respiratory specimens from, caring for, or transporting COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, gown, and gloves. If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.[19] Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuing use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.[20]
As business reopen across the world, measures are being developed to re-integrate workers in a manner that minimizes risks of transmission of COVID-19. Tools and publications with approaches to be taken to help with a safe and healthy return to work have been published by several health agencies and professional organizations. Examples include tool kits with fact sheets for workers and employers, infographics, and checklists for readiness to return to work.
Employers may require workers entering the workplace to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. Federal law does not prevent companies from requiring employees to provide documentation or discriminating against employees who fail to document vaccination status. Employers can also distribute information to employees and their family members on the benefits of vaccination, as well as offer incentives to encourage employees to get vaccinated, as long as the incentives are not coercive.
Many businesses are encouraging workers to get the jab rather than requiring them to do so.[21]
In the United States, Section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for raising concerns about safety and health conditions. OSHA encourages workers who suffer such retaliation to submit a complaint to OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program within the legal time limits.[14][22]
On July 15, 2020, Virginia adopted binding safety regulations on COVID-19, the first such regulations in the United States. The regulations includes mandates about control measures and prohibits retaliation against workers for expressing concern about infection risk, and provides for fines of up to US$130,000 for companies found in violation.[23][24] As of July 2020, Oregon adopted a timeline that targets the establishment of COVID-19 regulations for September 1.[25]

10,COVID-19 drug development,"



Vaccines (deployment)

COVID-19 drug development is the research process to develop preventative therapeutic prescription drugs that would alleviate the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). From early 2020 through 2021, several hundred drug companies, biotechnology firms, university research groups, and health organizations were developing therapeutic candidates for COVID-19 disease in various stages of preclinical or clinical research (682 total candidates in March 2021),[1] with 411 potential COVID-19 drugs in clinical trials, as of March 2021.[2]
As early as March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO),[3] European Medicines Agency (EMA),[4] US Food and Drug Administration (FDA),[5] and the Chinese government and drug manufacturers[6][7] were coordinating with academic and industry researchers to speed development of vaccines, antiviral drugs, and post-infection therapies.[8][9][10][11] The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the WHO recorded 536 clinical studies to develop post-infection therapies for COVID-19 infections,[12][13] with numerous established antiviral compounds for treating other infections under clinical research to be repurposed.[8][14][15][16]
In March 2020, the WHO initiated the ""SOLIDARITY Trial"" in 10 countries, enrolling thousands of people infected with COVID-19 to assess treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promise of efficacy.[3][17] A dynamic, systematic review was established in April 2020 to track the progress of registered clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic drug candidates.[13]
Drug development is a multistep process, typically requiring more than five years to assure safety and efficacy of the new compound.[18] Several national regulatory agencies, such as the EMA and the FDA, approved procedures to expedite clinical testing.[5][19] By March 2021, dozens of potential post-infection therapies were in the final stage of human testing – Phase III–IV clinical trials.[1][2][20]
Drug development is the process of bringing a new infectious disease vaccine or therapeutic drug to the market once a lead compound has been identified through the process of drug discovery.[18] It includes laboratory research on microorganisms and animals, filing for regulatory status, such as via the FDA, for an investigational new drug to initiate clinical trials on humans, and may include the step of obtaining regulatory approval with a new drug application to market the drug.[21][22] The entire process – from concept through preclinical testing in the laboratory to clinical trial development, including Phase I–III trials – to approved vaccine or drug normally takes more than a decade.[18][21][22]
The term ""preclinical research"" is defined by laboratory studies in vitro and in vivo, indicating a beginning stage for development of a preventative vaccine, antiviral or other post-infection therapies,[8] such as experiments to determine effective doses and toxicity in animals, before a candidate compound is advanced for safety and efficacy evaluation in humans.[23] To complete the preclinical stage of drug development – then be tested for safety and efficacy in an adequate number of people infected with COVID-19 (hundreds to thousands in different countries) – is a process likely to require 1–2 years for COVID-19 therapies, according to several reports in early 2020.[10][24][25][26] Despite these efforts, the success rate for drug candidates to reach eventual regulatory approval through the entire drug development process for treating infectious diseases is only 19%.[27]
Phase I trials test primarily for safety and preliminary dosing in a few dozen healthy subjects, while Phase II trials – following success in Phase I – evaluate therapeutic efficacy against the COVID-19 disease at ascending dose levels (efficacy based on biomarkers), while closely evaluating possible adverse effects of the candidate therapy (or combined therapies), typically in hundreds of people. A common trial design for Phase II studies of possible COVID-19 drugs is randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded, and conducted at multiple sites, while determining more precise, effective doses and monitoring for adverse effects.[28]
The success rate for Phase II trials to advance to Phase III (for all diseases) is about 31%, and for infectious diseases specifically, about 43%.[27] Depending on its duration (longer more expensive) – typically a period of several months to two years[28] – an average-length Phase II trial costs US$57 million (2013 dollars, including preclinical and Phase I costs).[29] Successful completion of a Phase II trial does not reliably forecast that a candidate drug will be successful in Phase III research.[30]
Phase III trials for COVID-19 involve hundreds-to-thousands of hospitalized participants, and test effectiveness of the treatment to reduce effects of the disease, while monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose, such as in the multinational Solidarity and Discovery trials.[3][18][31]
According to one source (as of August 2020), diverse categories of preclinical or early-stage clinical research for developing COVID-19 therapeutic candidates included:[20]
Pivotal Phase III trials assess whether a candidate drug has efficacy specifically against a disease, and – in the case of people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infections – test for an effective dose level of the repurposed or new drug candidate to improve the illness (primarily pneumonia) from COVID-19 infection.[3][12][33] For an already-approved drug (such as hydroxychloroquine for malaria), Phase III–IV trials determine in hundreds to thousands of COVID-19-infected people the possible extended use of an already-approved drug for treating COVID-19 infection.[33] As of August 2020, over 500 candidate therapeutics were in preclinical or a stage of Phase I–IV development,[1] with new Phase II–III trials announced for hundreds of therapeutic candidates during 2020.[20][1][2]
Numerous candidate drugs under study as ""supportive"" treatments to relieve discomfort during illness, such as NSAIDs or bronchodilators, are not included in the table below. Others in early-stage Phase II trials or numerous treatment candidates in Phase I trials,[20][1] are also excluded. Drug candidates in Phase I–II trials have a low rate of success (under 12%) to pass through all trial phases to gain eventual approval.[21][30] Once having reached Phase III trials, therapeutic candidates for diseases related to COVID-19 infection – infectious and respiratory diseases – have a success rate of about 72%.[27]
Drug repositioning (also called drug repurposing) – the investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic purposes – is one line of scientific research followed to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.[16][60] Several existing antiviral medications, previously developed or used as treatments for Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), HIV/AIDS, and malaria, are being researched as COVID-19 treatments, with some moving into clinical trials.[14]
During the COVID-19 pandemic, drug repurposing is the clinical research process of rapidly screening and defining the safety and efficacy of existing drugs already approved for other diseases to be used for people with COVID-19 infection.[14][16][61] In the usual drug development process,[18] confirmation of repurposing for new disease treatment would take many years of clinical research – including pivotal Phase III clinical trials – on the candidate drug to assure its safety and efficacy specifically for treating COVID-19 infection.[14][61] In the emergency of a growing COVID-19 pandemic, the drug repurposing process was being accelerated during March 2020 to treat people hospitalized with COVID-19.[3][14][16]
Clinical trials using repurposed, generally safe, existing drugs for hospitalized COVID-19 people may take less time and have lower overall costs to obtain endpoints proving safety (absence of serious side effects) and post-infection efficacy, and can rapidly access existing drug supply chains for manufacturing and worldwide distribution.[3][14][62] In an international effort to capture these advantages, the WHO began in mid-March 2020 expedited international Phase II–III trials on four promising treatment options – the SOLIDARITY trial[3][63][64] – with numerous other drugs having potential for repurposing in different disease treatment strategies, such as anti-inflammatory, corticosteroid, antibody, immune, and growth factor therapies, among others, being advanced into Phase II or III trials during 2020.[20][14][61][65]
In March, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a physician advisory concerning remdesivir for people hospitalized with pneumonia caused by COVID-19: ""While clinical trials are critical to establish the safety and efficacy of this drug, clinicians without access to a clinical trial may request remdesivir for compassionate use through the manufacturer for patients with clinical pneumonia.""[38]
Passive immunization with convalescent plasma or hyperimmune serum has been proposed as a potential treatment for COVID-19.[66]
In the United States, the FDA has granted temporary authorization to convalescent plasma (plasma from the blood of people who have recovered from COVID-19, which thus contains antibodies against SARS-CoV-2) as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.[67] However, convalescent plasma treatment has not undergone the randomized controlled or non-randomized clinical studies needed to determine if is safe and effective for treating people with COVID-19.[66][68][69]
Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, and Mexico have pursued development of antisera.[70] Brazil began development of an equine hyperimmune serum, obtained by inoculating horses with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in mid-2020. A consortium of Instituto Vital Brazil, UFRJ, the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation and the D’Or Institute for Research and Education in Rio de Janeiro began preclinical trials in May 2020,[71] while Instituto Butantan in São Paulo completed animal testing in September.[70] In December 2020, Argentina granted emergency authorization to CoviFab, a locally developed formulation of equine hyperimmune serum, for use in cases of moderate to severe COVID-19, based on the initial results of a single phase 2/3 trial which suggested reductions in mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation requirements in patients who received the serum.[72][73] This was harshly criticized by the Argentine Intensive Care Society, which stated that the trial failed to achieve its primary or secondary endpoints and did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences between the serum and placebo groups.[73]
Bamlanivimab (INN,[81] codenamed LY-CoV555) is a monoclonal antibody developed by AbCellera Biologics and Eli Lilly as a treatment for COVID-19.[82] The drug was granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2020,[83][84][85] and 950,000 doses have been bought by the US government as of December 2020.[86] In April 2021, the EUA was revoked.[87]
The drug is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.[88] The aim is to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, and help preventing and treating COVID-19.[82]
Bamlanivimab emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.[82]
In May 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) concluded that sotrovimab can be used to treat confirmed COVID-19 in people aged twelve years and older, weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb), who do not require supplemental oxygen therapy, and who are at risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.[92]
On 26 May 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for sotrovimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in people twelve years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.[93]
Sometime in early 2021, Pfizer commenced Phase I human trials in the United States and Belgium of a novel oral prescriptive medication, PF-07321332, a 'protease inhibitor' that debilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication. The trials, spread across 3 phases, are expected to take over 5 months. The drug is administered with low doses of ritonavir, an antiviral used to treat HIV.[94]
Over 2018–20, new initiatives to stimulate vaccine and antiviral drug development included partnerships between governmental organizations and industry, such as the European Innovative Medicines Initiative,[95] the US Critical Path Initiative to enhance innovation of drug development,[96] and the Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite development and regulatory review of promising candidate drugs.[97] To accelerate refinement of diagnostics for detecting COVID-19 infection, a global diagnostic pipeline tracker was formed.[98]
According to two organizations tracking clinical trial progress on potential therapeutic drugs for COVID-19 infections, 29 Phase II–IV efficacy trials were concluded in March or scheduled to provide results in April from hospitals in China – which experienced the first outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019.[1][20] Seven trials were evaluating repurposed drugs already approved to treat malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine phosphate.[20] Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the Chinese research, with 9 Phase III trials on remdesivir across several countries due to report by the end of April.[20] Other potential therapeutic candidates under pivotal clinical trials concluding in March–April are vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, among others.
The COVID-19 Clinical Research Coalition has goals to 1) facilitate rapid reviews of clinical trial proposals by ethics committees and national regulatory agencies, 2) fast-track approvals for the candidate therapeutic compounds, 3) ensure standardised and rapid analysis of emerging efficacy and safety data, and 4) facilitate sharing of clinical trial outcomes before publication.[12] A dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was in place, as of April.[13]
By March 2020, the international Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) committed to research investments of US$100 million across several countries,[99] and issued an urgent call to raise and rapidly invest $2 billion for vaccine development.[100] Led by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with partners investing US$125 million and coordinating with the World Health Organization, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator began in March, facilitating drug development researchers to rapidly identify, assess, develop, and scale up potential treatments.[101] The COVID-19 Clinical Research Coalition formed to coordinate and expedite results from international clinical trials on the most promising post-infection treatments.[12] In early 2020, numerous established antiviral compounds for treating other infections were being repurposed or developed in new clinical research efforts to alleviate the illness of COVID-19.[8][14][20]
During March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) initiated an international COVID-19 vaccine development fund, with the goal to raise US$2 billion for vaccine research and development,[102] and committed to investments of US$100 million in vaccine development across several countries.[99] The Canadian government announced CA$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian universities,[103][104] with plans to establish a ""vaccine bank"" of new vaccines for implementation if another COVID-19 outbreak occurs.[104][105] The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation invested US$150 million in April for development of COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics.[106]
According to a source reporting early-stage clinical trials on potential COVID-19 post-infection therapies, there were over 230 Phase II trials underway or planned to start by October 2020.[2]
In March 2020, the United States Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, NASA, industry, and nine universities pooled resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, for drug discovery.[107][108] The COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium also aims to forecast disease spread, model possible vaccines, and screen thousands of chemical compounds to design a COVID-19 vaccine or therapy.[107][108]
The C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute, an additional consortium of Microsoft, six universities (including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a member of the first consortium), and the National Center for Supercomputer Applications in Illinois, working under the auspices of C3.ai, an artificial intelligence software company, are pooling supercomputer resources toward drug discovery, medical protocol development and public health strategy improvement, as well as awarding large grants to researchers who proposed by May to use AI to carry out similar tasks.[109][110]
In March 2020, the distributed computing project Folding@home launched a program to assist drug developers, initially simulating protein targets from SARS-CoV-2 and the related SARS-CoV virus, which has been studied previously.[111][112][113]
Distributed computing project Rosetta@home also joined the effort in March. The project uses computers of volunteers to model SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins to discover possible drug targets or create new proteins to neutralize the virus. Researchers revealed that with the help of Rosetta@home, they had been able to “accurately predict the atomic-scale structure of an important coronavirus protein weeks before it could be measured in the lab.”[114]
In May 2020, the OpenPandemics – COVID-19 partnership between Scripps Research and IBM's World Community Grid was launched. The partnership is a distributed computing project that ""will automatically run a simulated experiment in the background [of connected home PCs] which will help predict the effectiveness of a particular chemical compound as a possible treatment for COVID-19"".[115]
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the coordinated ""Solidarity Trial"" in 10 countries on five continents to rapidly assess in thousands of COVID-19 infected people the potential efficacy of existing antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents not yet evaluated specifically for COVID-19 illness.[3][17] By late April, hospitals in over 100 countries were involved in the trial.[116]
The individual or combined drugs undergoing initial studied are 1) lopinavir–ritonavir combined, 2) lopinavir–ritonavir combined with interferon-beta, 3) remdesivir or 4) (hydroxy)chloroquine in separate trials and hospital sites internationally.[3][17] Following a study published by The Lancet on safety concerns with hydroxychloroquine, the WHO suspended use of it from the Solidarity trial in May 2020,[117][118] reinstated it after the research was retracted,[119] then abandoned further use of the drug for COVID-19 treatment when analysis showed in June that it provided no benefit.[44]
With about 15% of people infected by COVID-19 having severe illness, and hospitals being overwhelmed during the pandemic, WHO recognized a rapid clinical need to test and repurpose these drugs as agents already approved for other diseases and recognized as safe.[3] The Solidarity project is designed to give rapid insights to key clinical questions:[3][120]
Enrolling people with COVID-19 infection is simplified by using data entries, including informed consent, on a WHO website. After the trial staff determines the drugs available at the hospital, the WHO website randomizes the hospitalized subject to one of the trial drugs or to the hospital standard of care for treating COVID-19. The trial physician records and submits follow-up information about the subject status and treatment, completing data input via the WHO Solidarity website. The design of the Solidarity trial is not double-blind – which is normally the standard in a high-quality clinical trial – but the WHO needed speed with quality for the trial across many hospitals and countries.[3] A global safety monitoring board of WHO physicians examine interim results to assist decisions on safety and effectiveness of the trial drugs, and alter the trial design or recommend an effective therapy.[3][120] A similar web-based study to Solidarity, called ""Discovery"", was initiated in March across seven countries by INSERM (Paris, France).[3][35]
The Solidarity trial seeks to implement coordination across hundreds of hospital sites in different countries – including those with poorly-developed infrastructure for clinical trials – yet needs to be conducted rapidly. According to John-Arne Røttingen, chief executive of the Research Council of Norway and chairman of the Solidarity trial international steering committee, the trial would be considered effective if therapies are determined to ""reduce the proportion of patients that need ventilators by, say, 20%, that could have a huge impact on our national health-care systems.""[31]
During March, funding for the Solidarity trial reached US$108 million from 203,000 individuals, organizations and governments, with 45 countries involved in financing or trial management.[117]
A clinical trial design in progress may be modified as an ""adaptive design"" if accumulating data in the trial provide early insights about positive or negative efficacy of the treatment.[121][122] The global Solidarity and European Discovery trials of hospitalized people with severe COVID-19 infection apply adaptive design to rapidly alter trial parameters as results from the four experimental therapeutic strategies emerge.[12][35][123] Adaptive designs within ongoing Phase II–III clinical trials on candidate therapeutics may shorten trial durations and use fewer subjects, possibly expediting decisions for early termination or success, and coordinating design changes for a specific trial across its international locations.[30][122][124]
The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) initiated an adaptive design, international Phase III trial (called ""ACTT"") to involve up to 800 hospitalized COVID-19 people at 100 sites in multiple countries. Beginning with use of remdesivir as the primary treatment over 29 days, the trial definition of its adaptive protocol states that ""there will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s).""[39]
A large-scale, randomized controlled trial named the RECOVERY Trial was set up in March 2020, in the UK to test possible treatments for COVID-19. It is run by the Nuffield Departments of Public Health and of Medicine at the University of Oxford and is testing five repurposed drugs and also convalescent plasma. The trial enrolled more than 11,500 COVID-19 positive participants in the U.K by June 2020.[45][125][126]
During April, the British RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY) trial was launched initially in 132 hospitals across the UK,[127] expanding to become one of the world's largest COVID-19 clinical studies, involving 5400 infected people under treatment at 165 UK hospitals, as of mid-April.[128] The trial is examining different potential therapies for severe COVID-19 infection: lopinavir/ritonavir, low-dose dexamethasone (an anti-inflammatory steroid), hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin (a common antibiotic).[125] In June, the trial arm using hydroxychloroquine was discontinued when analyses showed it provided no benefit.[45]
On 16 June the trial group released a statement that dexamethasone had been shown to reduce mortality in patients receiving respiratory support.[129] In a controlled trial around 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and were compared with more than 4,000 who did not receive the drug. For patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28% (1 in 8). For patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20% (1 in 5).[130]
By the end of June 2020, the trial had published findings regarding hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone.[45][131] It had also announced results for lopinavir/ritonavir which were published in October 2020. The lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine arms were closed to new entrants after being shown to be ineffective.[45][132][133] Dexamethasone was closed to new adult entries after positive results and by November 2020, was open to child entries.

11,Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,"




By industry
The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector.[1] The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown.[2]
Supply shortages are expected to affect a number of sectors due to panic buying, increased usage of goods to fight the pandemic, and disruption to factories and logistics in mainland China. There have been instances of price gouging.[3] There have been widespread reports of shortages of pharmaceuticals,[4] with many areas seeing panic buying and consequent shortages of food and other essential grocery items.[5][6][7] The technology industry, in particular, has been warning about delays to shipments of electronic goods.[8][needs update]
Global stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.[9][10] By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis.[11][12][13] Global stock markets crashed in March 2020, with falls of several percent in the world's major indices.
Possible instability generated by an outbreak and associated behavioural changes could result in temporary food shortages, price spikes, and disruption to markets. Such price rises would be felt most by vulnerable populations who depend on markets for their food as well as those already depending on humanitarian assistance to maintain their livelihoods and food access. As observed in the 2007–2008 food prices crisis, the additional inflationary effect of protectionist policies through import tariffs and export bans could cause a significant increase in the number of people facing severe food insecurity worldwide.[14]
The pandemic has forced to switch the plans globally. All fashion, sport, and technology events have been canceled or have changed to be online.[15][16] While the monetary impact on the travel and trade industry is yet to be estimated, it is likely to be in the billions and increasing.
Amidst the recovery and containment, the world economic system is characterized as experiencing significant, broad uncertainty. Economic forecasts and consensus among Macroeconomics experts show significant disagreement on the overall extent, long-term effects and projected recovery.[17] Risk assessments and contingency plans therefore must be taken with a grain of salt, given that there is a wide divergence of opinion.
The initial outbreak of the pandemic in China coincided with the Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday. A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.[19][20] Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.[21] In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most workplaces not to re-open until that date.[22][23] These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.[23] Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations.[24][25]
The demand for personal protection equipment has risen 100-fold, according to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom. This demand has led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also induced delays on the supply of medical items for four to six months.[26][27]
The COVID-19 recession is an economic recession happening across the world economy in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[28][29][30][31] Global stock markets experienced their worst crash since 1987,[32] and in the first three months of 2020 the G20 economies fell 3.4% year-on-year.[33] Between April and June 2020, the International Labour Organization estimated that an equivalent of 400 million full-time jobs were lost across the world,[34] and income earned by workers globally fell 10 percent in the first nine months of 2020, equivalent to a loss of over US$3.5 trillion.[35]
Nations, cities and other collectives with governance mechanisms worldwide have announced the development and implementation of programmes for guided economic recovery.[36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43] Some economic recovery programmes include Next Generation EU and Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme.
A study published in August 2020 concluded that the direct effect of the response to the pandemic on global warming will likely be negligible and that a well-designed economic recovery could avoid future warming of 0.3 °C by 2050. The study indicates that systemic change for ""decarbonization"" of humanity's economic structures is required for a substantial impact on global warming, which also has economic aspects.[44][45] Beyond targeted financing of green projects or sectors, contemporary decision-making mechanisms also allow for excluding projects with substantial environmental, social, or climate risks from financial relief. Over 260 civil society organizations called on Chinese actors to ensure that COVID-19 related Belt and Road Initiative funding excludes such projects.[46] In November 2020 the IMF said that governments and central banks had promised $19.5 trillion of support since the coronavirus began.[47]
In food crisis countries, up to 80 percent of the population relies on agriculture for their livelihoods. Therefore, any further disruptions to food production and related value chains, for example in the form of reduced availability of critical inputs or restricted access to lands or markets, could be catastrophic for vulnerable populations.[14]
The agriculture sector plays an important role in influencing migratory patterns. Transhumant pastoral populations are likely to be hard hit by any border closures, as they rely on seasonal movements of livestock for their food and income. The disruption of traditional and western patterns and the creation of new ones may lead to tensions and even violent conflicts between resident and pastoralist communities, resulting in local displacement and increased levels of poverty and food insecurity.[14]
According to FAO, it is crucial to maintain and support the continuous functioning of local food markets, value chains and agri-food systems in food crisis contexts, including through ongoing and scaled up support to food processing, transport, marketing, and so forth; strengthening of local producers’ groups to maintain negotiation power and access to markets; and, advocating for trade corridors to remain open as much as possible during COVID-19 related movement restrictions.69[14]
Economic turmoil associated with the coronavirus pandemic has wide-ranging and severe impacts upon financial markets, including stock, bond and commodity (including crude oil and gold) markets. Major events included the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war that resulted in a collapse of crude oil prices and a stock market crash in March 2020. The United Nations Development Programme expects a US$220 billion reduction in revenue in developing countries, and expects COVID-19's economic impact to last for months or even years.[48][32] Some expect natural gas prices to fall.[49]
During the early phase of COVID in April and May, there was a significant correlation between the extent of the outbreak and volatility in financial and stock markets.[50] The broader effects of this volatility impacted credit markets, and save for government interventions and central banks pursuing quantitative easing, would have led to more significant economic downturns.
New vehicle sales in the United States have declined by 40%.[51] The American Big Three have all shut down their US factories.[52] The German automotive industry came into the crisis after having already suffered from the Dieselgate-scandal, as well as competition from electric cars.[53] Boeing and Airbus suspended production at some factories. A survey conducted by the British Plastics Federation (BPF) explored how COVID-19 is impacting manufacturing businesses in the United Kingdom (UK). Over 80% of respondents anticipated a decline in turnover over the next 2 quarters, with 98% admitting concern about the negative impact of the pandemic on business operations.[54][55]
The epidemic had a sudden and substantial impact on the arts and cultural heritage (GLAM) sectors worldwide. The global health crisis and the uncertainty resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals – both employed and independent – across the sector. By March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. Many individuals temporarily or permanently lost contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, financial stimulus from governments and charities for artists, have provided greatly differing levels of support, depending on the sector and the country. In countries such as Australia, where the arts contributed to about 6.4% of GDP, effects on individuals and the economy have been significant.[56][57]
The pandemic has impacted the film industry. Across the world and to varying degrees, cinemas have been closed, festivals have been cancelled or postponed, and film releases have been moved to future dates. As cinemas closed, the global box office dropped by billions of dollars, while streaming became more popular and the stock of Netflix rose; the stock of film exhibitors dropped dramatically. Almost all blockbusters to be released after the March opening weekend were postponed or cancelled around the world, with film productions also halted. Massive losses in the industry have been predicted.[58]
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed,[59] including the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which were postponed on 24 March 2020 until 2021.[60][61]
The COVID-19 pandemic has shut down or delayed production of television programs in several countries.[citation needed] However, a joint report from Apptopia and Braze[62] showed a 30.7% increase in streaming sessions worldwide on platforms such as Disney+, Netflix, and Hulu during the month of March.[63]
The pandemic also affected the video game sector to a smaller degree. As the outbreak appeared in China first, supply chains affected the manufacturing and production of some video game consoles, delaying their releases and making current supplies scarcer. As the outbreak and pandemic spread, several keystone trade events, including E3 2020, were cancelled over concerns of further spread. The economic impact on the video game sector is not expected to be as large as in film or other entertainment sectors as much of the work in video game production can be decentralised and performed remotely, and products distributed digitally to consumers regardless of various national and regional lockdowns on businesses and services.[64]
The pandemic had an interesting impact regarding medicine-related elements such as plastic surgery.Why plastic-surgery demand is booming amid lockdown
The pandemic is predicted to have a dire effect on local newspapers in the United States, where many were already severely struggling beforehand.[65]
In light of the public health situation in which includes afflicted regions where retail sectors deemed non-essential have been ordered closed for the interim,[66] Diamond Comic Distributors announced on 24 March 2020 a full suspension of distributing published material and related merchandise as 1 April 2020 until further notice.[67] As Diamond has a near-monopoly on printed comic book distribution, this is described as an ""extinction-level event"" that threatens to drive the entire specialized comic book retail sector out of business with that one move.[68] As a result, publishers like IDW Publishing and Dark Horse Comics have suspended publication of their periodicals while DC Comics is exploring distribution alternatives including an increased focus on online retail of digital material.[69]
Total US book sales went down by 8.4% in March 2020 compared to March 2019 after the stay-at-home orders were implemented,[70] with bookstore sales dropping by an estimated 33%.[71] By June 2020, demand began to recover with the exception of educational material and bookstore sales, with most sales going to Amazon and big-box stores, who were open since they were considered essential businesses.[72][73] Books that were initially supposed to be published in spring and early summer were delayed till fall, with the expectation that the pandemic would be over by then. Two of the major printing companies, Quad and LSC Communications, faced financial issues into the latter half of the year as the latter declared bankruptcy during a rise in demand. Increased sales were attributed to major book releases and increased demand for children's books and books about race and racism. This created supply chain bottleneck at the printing process for most publishers.[74] According to NPD BookScan, print sales went up almost 8% in 2020.[73]
The pandemic has impacted the retail sector. Shopping centres around the world responded by reducing hours or closing down temporarily. As of 18 March 2020, the footfall to shopping centres fell by up to 30%, with significant impact in every continent.[75] Additionally, product demand exceeded supply for many consumables, resulting in empty retail shelves.[76][77] In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigou shoppers to re-sell into the China market. ""The virus crisis, while frightening, has a silver lining"".[78][79]
Some retailers have employed contactless home delivery or curbside pickup for items purchased through e-commerce sites.[80][81] By April, retailers had started implementing ""retail to go"" models where consumers could pick up their orders. An estimated 40% of shoppers were shopping online and choosing to pick up in-store, a behavior that had suddenly doubled as compared to the previous year.[82]
Small-scale farmers have been embracing digital technologies as a way to directly sell produce, and community-supported agriculture and direct-sell delivery systems are on the rise.[83]
In mid-April, Amazon confirmed that workers at over half of its 110 U.S. warehouses had been diagnosed with coronavirus.[85]
On 16 June, the United States Department of Commerce announced that retail sales for the month of May had seen an increase of 17.7% from April as states began to reopen and lift restrictions. According to CNBC, This marks the biggest one month jump in the history of retailing in the United States.[86] Numbers for June reflected a 7.5 percent rise in sales.[87]
By April, department store retailers JCPenney, Nordstrom, Macy's and Kohl's had lost $12.3 billion combined in market caps. Neiman Marcus and JCPenney defaulted on bond payments in April, preparing internally for bankruptcy court and bankruptcy protection.[88] J.Crew and Neiman Marcus filed for bankruptcy during the first week of May; they were reportedly the first two major retailers to do so during the pandemic.[89][90] JCPenney filed for bankruptcy on 15 May.[91]
In May, Pier 1 announced it would close as soon as possible. It had sought court protection in February and had hoped that someone would buy the business, but the subsequent recession made this seem unlikely.[92]
In early 2021, Family Video announced all their remaining stores would be liquidated and closed down.
The pandemic has impacted the restaurant business. In the beginning of March 2020, some major cities in the US announced that bars and restaurants would be closed to sit-down dinners and limited to takeout orders and delivery.[93] Later in the month, many states put in place restrictions that required restaurants to be takeout or delivery only.[94] Some employees were fired, and more employees lacked sick leave in the sector compared to similar sectors.[95][96] With only carry-out and delivery services, most servers and bartenders were laid off, prompting these employees creating ""virtual tip jars"" across 23 U.S. cities.[97] In the United States, an initiative known as the ""Great American Takeout"" called on people under quarantine to support local restaurants each Tuesday by ordering takeout for curbside pickup or using food delivery services. It began in late March 2020.[98]
The pandemic has impacted productivity of science, space and technology projects, and to the world's leading space agencies – including NASA and the European Space Agency having to halt production of the Space Launch System, James Webb Space Telescope, and put space science probes into hibernation or low power mode. Most of both agencies' field centers have directed most personnel to telework. Various IT companies had launched several programs to sustain in this pandemic and in this new normal life.[99][100][101][102][103] The pandemic may have improved scientific communication or established new forms of it. For instance a lot of data is being released on preprint servers and is getting dissected on social Internet platforms and sometimes in the media before entering formal peer review. Scientists are reviewing, editing, analyzing and publishing manuscripts and data at record speeds and in large numbers. This intense communication may have allowed an unusual level of collaboration and efficiency among scientists.[104]
Philia Tounta summarised likely effects of COVID-19 on global tourism early in March 2020:[109]
The pandemic has caused the cancellation or postponement of major events around the world. Some public venues and institutions have closed.[110]
The cruise ship industry has also been heavily affected by a downturn, with the share prices of the major cruise lines down 70–80%.[111]
In many of the world's cities, planned travel went down by 80–90%.[112]
The pandemic has had a significant impact on the aviation industry due to the resulting travel restrictions as well as a slump in demand among travellers. Significant reductions in passenger numbers have resulted in planes flying empty between airports and the cancellation of flights.
United States passenger airlines can expect about $50 billion in subsidies from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.[113]
Cruise lines had to cancel sailings after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bookings and cancellations grew as extensive media coverage of ill passengers on quarantined ships hurt the industry's image.[113]
Cruise line stock fell sharply on 27 March 2020 when the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act excluded companies that are not ""organized"" under United States law. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) tweeted: ""The giant cruise companies incorporate overseas to dodge US taxes, flag vessels overseas to avoid US taxes and laws, and pollute without offset. Why should we bail them out?"" Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) tweeted that cruise lines should register and pay taxes in the United States if they expect a financial bailout. U.S-based employees and small, American-owned companies are eligible for financial assistance.[113]
Several rail operators had to receive state aid and/or reduced their scheduled services. Deutsche Bahn received billions of € in federal aid to cover record losses.[114][115][116][117][118][119]
According to the American Gaming Association, the industry will be hit by losses up to $43.5 billion in economic activity in the following months. Some projection was that the sports gambling industry may lose $140 million alone in the fourth weekend of March (21–22 March 2020) on lost NCAA basketball tournament bets.[120] Gambling companies are eager to shift customers from retail into online casino and poker games in order to fight the loss of revenue due to the cancellation of sports fixtures and the shutdown of betting shops. Gambling groups increased the advertising of online casino games and play on social media. Some argue that virtual racing, as well as draw based games, are also proving popular.[121][122] Some software betting providers have specially designed campaigns promoting online betting solutions in order to attract betting companies. Long term consequences to the betting and gambling industry might be: Death of small retail operators and providers, increase in M&A, more focus on online, innovation in online meaning that even the existing products like the sportsbook will pay closer attention to obscure sports like soap soccer or quidditch and more prominent spot for virtual games online.[123]
In Macau, the world's top gambling destination by revenue, all casinos were closed for 15 days in February 2020[124] and suffered a year-on-year revenue drop of 88%, the worst ever recorded in the territory.[125]
The International Labour Organization stated on 7 April that it predicted a 6.7% loss of job hours globally in the second quarter of 2020, equivalent to 195 million full-time jobs. They also estimated that 30 million jobs were lost in the first quarter alone, compared to 25 million during the 2008 financial crisis.[126]
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.[127] Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.[128][129]
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.[130] Total nonfarm jobs fell from a high of 152.5 million in February 2020 to 130.2 million in April. As of February 2021, the US had 13 million nonfarm jobs.[131]
The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of migrant workers unemployed.[132][133]
The survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some type of job loss.[134][135]
Nearly 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since it went into lockdown in mid-March 2020.[136] During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme.[137]
Almost half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers on a government-subsidized short-time working schemes known as Kurzarbeit.[138][139] The German short-time work compensation scheme has been copied by France and Britain.[140]
The pandemic's economic impacts are likely to increase sexual exploitation and child marriage, leaving women and girls in fragile economies and refugee contexts particularly vulnerable.[141][142][143]
The potential combined impact of COVID-19 on unemployment, households’ purchasing power, food prices, and food availability in local markets could severely jeopardize access to food in the most vulnerable countries.[14]
Around the world, women generally earn less and save less, are the majority of single-parent households and disproportionately hold more insecure jobs in the informal economy or service sector with less access to social protections. This leaves them less able to absorb the economic shocks than men.[144][145][146][147][148][149][150] For many families, school closures and social distancing measures have increased the unpaid care and domestic load of women at home, making them less able to take on or balance paid work. The situation is worse in developing economies, where a larger share of people are employed in the informal economy in which there are far fewer social protections for health insurance, paid sick leave and more. Although globally informal employment is a greater source of employment for men (63 per cent) than for women (58 per cent), in low and lower-middle income countries a higher proportion of women are in informal employment than men.[144][145][146][147][148][149][150] In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, around 92 per cent of employed women are in informal employment compared to 86 per cent of men. It is likely that the pandemic could result in a prolonged dip in women's incomes and labour force participation. The ILO estimates global unemployment to rise between 5.3 million (“low” scenario) and 24.7 million (“high” scenario) from a base level of 188 million in 2019 as a result of COVID-19's impact on global GDP growth. By comparison, global unemployment went up by 22 million during the 2008-9 global financial crisis. Women informal workers, migrants, youth and the world's poorest, among other vulnerable groups, are more susceptible to lay-offs and job cuts. For example, UN Women survey results from Asia and the Pacific are showing that women are losing their livelihoods faster than men and have fewer alternatives to generate income. And, in the U.S., men's unemployment went up from 3.55 million in February to 11 million in April in 2020 while women's unemployment – which was lower than men's before the crisis – went up from 2.7 million to 11.5 million over the same period, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The picture is even bleaker for young women and men aged 16–19, whose unemployment rate jumped from 11.5 per cent in February to 32.2 per cent in April.[144][145][146][147][148][149][150] In Japan, women have been disproportionately hit by the Covid pandemic because sectors like retail and hospitality employ many women and have been heavily affected by the pandemic recession. According to the health ministry, the suicide rate among Japanese women rose 14.5% in 2020, while it fell by 1% among men. [151]
The global GDP total had shrunk by nearly $22 trillion as of January 2021, during the course of the pandemic.[152] According to Chief IMF Economist Gita Gopinath, the long-term consequences have not fully played out but could be expected to be in the trillions from 2020 to 2025.
Post-COVID economic recovery prospects are high, and most countries are expected to see higher than usual economic growth. This is different from conventional economic recessions, according to the IMF.[153] The China, India, ASEAN nations and other emerging Asian economies are expected to continue growing most significantly throughout the 2020s, and is expected to dominate global economic growth following the pandemic.[153]
The economy of China was anticipated to generate billions in economic output. Morgan Stanley expected the economy of China to grow by between 5.6% (worst-case scenario) to 5.9% for 2020.[154] For reference, China generated US$143 billion in February 2019, the month of Chinese New Year.[155] The Chinese Ministry of Transport reported that trips on trains dropped 73% to 190 million trips from the previous year. Factories, retailers, and restaurant chains closed.[156]

Tourism in China has been hit hard by travel restrictions and fears of contagion, including a ban on both domestic and international tour groups.[159] Many airlines have either cancelled or greatly reduced flights to China and several travel advisories now warn against travel to China. Many countries, including France, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, have evacuated their nationals from the Wuhan and Hubei provinces.[160]
The majority of schools and universities have extended their annual holidays to mid-February.[161] Overseas students enrolled at Chinese universities have been returning home over fears of being infected—the first cases to be reported by Nepal and Kerala, a southern state of India, were both of students who had returned home.[162][163] Nearly 200 million students have been affected by the in-school closures, with the second semester after the Chunyun resuming on 17 February through online classes for students to follow from their homes instead. The Ministry of Education has introduced a 7,000-server supported ""national Internet cloud classroom"" to cater to the 50 million elementary and middle school student populations.[164]

This permanently extends the temporary ban already in place since the end of January.[168][169]
According to Carbon Brief, the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in China's greenhouse gas emissions being reduced by 25%.[170] In March 2020, satellite images from space provided by NASA revealed that pollution has dropped significantly, which has been attributed in part to the slowdown of economic activity as a result of the outbreak.[171]
As the epidemic accelerated, the mainland market saw a shortage of face masks due to the increased need from the public.[172] It was reported that Shanghai customers had to queue for nearly an hour to buy a pack of face masks which was sold out in another half an hour.[173] Some stores hoarded supplies, driving up prices, so the market regulator cracked down on such acts.[174][175] The shortage will not be relieved until late February, when most workers return from the New Year vacation, according to Lei Limin, an expert in the industry.[176][needs update]
On 22 January 2020, Taobao, China's largest e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba Group, said that all face masks on Taobao and Tmall would not be allowed to increase in price. Special subsidies would be provided to the retailers. Also, Alibaba Health's ""urgent drug delivery"" service would not be closed during the Spring Festival.[177] JD, another leading Chinese e-commerce platform, said, ""We are actively working to ensure supply and price stability from sources, storage and distribution, platform control and so on"" and ""while fully ensuring price stability for JD's own commodities, JD.com has also exercised strict control over the commodities on JD's platform. Third-party vendors selling face masks are prohibited from raising prices. Once it is confirmed that the prices of third-party vendors have increased abnormally, JD will immediately remove the offending commodities from shelves and deal with the offending vendors accordingly.""[178] Other major e-commerce platforms including Sunning.com and Pinduoduo also promised to keep the prices of health products stable.[179][180]
China's economic growth is expected to slow by up to 1.1% in the first half of 2020 as economic activity is negatively affected by the new coronavirus pandemic, according to a Morgan Stanley study cited by Reuters.[181] But on 1 February 2020, the People's Bank of China said that the impact of the epidemic on China's economy was temporary and that the fundamentals of China's long-term positive and high-quality growth remained unchanged.[182] In late January, economists predicted a V-shaped recovery. By March, it was much more uncertain.[183]
Due to the outbreak, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange announced that with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the closing time for the Spring Festival will be extended to 2 February and trading will resume on 3 February.[184][185] Before that, on 23 January, the last trading day of a shares before the Spring Festival, all three major stock indexes opened lower, creating a drop of about 3%, and the Shanghai Composite Index fell below 3000.[186] On 2 February, the first trading day after the holiday, the three major indexes even set a record low opening of about 8%.[187] By the end of the day, the decline narrowed slightly to about 7%, the Shenzhen index fell below 10,000 points, a total of 3,177 stocks in the two markets fell.[188]

However, the government also stated an intention to create 9 million new urban jobs until the end of 2020.[194]
In October 2020, it was announced that China's third-quarter GDP has grown with 4.9%, hereby missing analysts expectations (which was set at 5,2%). However, it does show that China's economy has indeed been steadily recovering from the coronavirus shock that caused decades-low growth.[195] To fuel economic growth, the country set aside hundreds of billions of dollars for major infrastructure projects and utilized population tracking policies and enforced the stringent lockdown to contain the virus.[196] It is the only major economy that is expected to grow in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund.[197]
By December 2020, China's economic recovery was accelerating amid increasing demand for manufactured goods.[198] The UK-based Centre for Economics and Business Research projected that China's ""skilful management of the pandemic"" would cause the Chinese economy to surpass the United States and become the world's largest economy by nominal GDP in 2028, five years sooner than previously expected.[199][200]
Hong Kong has seen high-profile protests that saw tourist arrivals from mainland China plummet over an eight-month period. The viral epidemic put additional pressure on the travel sector to withstand a prolonged period of downturn.[201] A drop in arrivals from third countries more resilient during the previous months has also been cited as a concern.[160] The city is already in recession[201] and Moody has lowered the city's credit rating.[202][203]
There has also been a renewed increase in protest activity as hostile sentiment against mainland Chinese strengthened over fears of viral transmission from mainland China, with many calling for the border ports to be closed and for all mainland Chinese travellers to be refused entry. Incidents have included a number of petrol bombs being thrown at police stations,[204] a homemade bomb exploding in a toilet,[205] and foreign objects being thrown onto transit rail tracks between Hong Kong and the mainland Chinese border.[206] Political issues raised have included concerns that mainland Chinese may prefer to travel to Hong Kong to seek free medical help (which has since been addressed by the Hong Kong government).[207][208]
Since the outbreak of the virus, a significant number of products have been sold out across the city, including face masks and disinfectant products (such as alcohol and bleach).[209] An ongoing period of panic buying has also caused many stores to be cleared of non-medical products such as bottled water, vegetables and rice.[210] The Government of Hong Kong had its imports of face masks cancelled as global face mask stockpiles decline.[211]
In view of the coronavirus pandemic, the Education Bureau closed all kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools, and special schools until 17 February.[212] This has been extended for multiple times due to the development of the epidemic,[213][214][215] until the Bureau announced that all schools would be indefinitely suspended until further notice on 31 March.[216] The disruption has raised concerns over the situation of students who are due to take examinations at the end of the year, especially in light of the protest-related disruption that happened in 2019.[217]

In India, economists expect the near-term impact of the outbreak to be limited to the supply chains of major conglomerates, especially pharmaceuticals, fertilisers, automobiles, textiles and electronics. A severe impact on global trade logistics is also expected due to disruption of logistics in mainland China, but due to the combined risk with regional geopolitical tensions, wider trade wars and Brexit.[255] The stock market took a bearish mode in response to COVID-19.

This was after the economy shrank some 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020 from the same quarter in 2019.[271] On 26 May, the Singapore economy contracted 0.7%YoY, which was better than the expected contraction of 2.2%. However, MTI said that it was revising down its expectation for the Singapore economy in 2020 to shrink by 4% to 7%.[272] Economists were behind the curve in downgrading their numbers.[273] Euben Paracuelles, at Nomura argued that while some ASEAN economies had success in containing the virus, the presence of global uncertainties meant that any regional recovery would be restrained.

Deep South states such as Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana reported on April 6 that 70% of its reported deaths had involved African Americans.[372][373] It has been acknowledged that African Americans were more likely to have poor living conditions (including dense urban environments and poverty), employment instability, chronic comorbidities influenced by these conditions, and little to no health insurance coverage—factors which can all exacerbate its impact.[374][375]
In April, nearly a quarter of residents (renters and homeowners) did not pay full housing costs.

Many workers were furloughed or laid off as a result of business and school closures and the cancellation of public events. During April more than 20 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance, an all-time record, and the national unemployment rate was reported as 14.7% - the highest monthly rate since record keeping was begun in 1948.[381] The rise in unemployment may have contributed to protracted nationwide civil unrest.[382][383]

But the pandemic did not result in noticeable changes in advertised wages.""[389]
In December 2020, economist David Choi at Goldman Sachs argued that the U.S. economy would recover faster than expected as impact on the parts of the economy most susceptible to the recent coronavirus spread weren't being affected as severely.[390] On the flipside, Alejandra Grindal at Ned Davis Research, argued that the economy could get worse if the pandemic worsens prior to the deployment of vaccines in Q2 2021, after which the economy would see ""a pretty sharp recovery not only in U.S. economic activity, but also global economic activity"".[391]
Latin American and Caribbean countries were already facing low economic growth before COVID-19, with the region averaging 0.4% of growth in 2019, due to what was described as ""a vicious circle of low-quality jobs, deficient social protection and volatile incomes"" with one out of five in the ages of 14-25 being unable to find a job. The economic impact caused by COVID-19 was exarcebated by many countries' lack of reserve funds for times of crisis. Between 35 and 50 million people in the region are expected to fall below the poverty line, which is set at US$5.60 per day. Exports have also been affected and many countries are expected to fall further into debt.[392] The LAC region is experiencing the biggest contraction in the emerging markets and developing economies. The IMF World Economic Outlook has reported a GDP contraction of 8.1 per cent in Latin America in 2020. Unfortunately, since 2014, the region has been experiencing the weakest period of growth since 1950.[393]

Mining companies are thought to be highly exposed to the outbreak, since sales to China constitute 93% of the sales of Fortescue Metals, 55% of the sales of BHP, and 45% of the sales of Rio Tinto.[409] The iron ore shipping gauge dropped 99.9% as a result of the outbreak,[412] and the virus has made shipping and logistic operations of mining companies more complicated.[413]
Agriculture is also experiencing negative effects from the outbreak,[414] including the Australian dairy industry,[415] fishing industry,[416] wine producers,[417] and meat producers.[403] On 13 February 2020, Rabobank, which specialises in agricultural banking, warned that the agricultural sector had eight weeks for the coronavirus to be contained before facing major losses.[418] Exports were also affected by the outbreak. In May, China—which is Australia's largest trading partner—stopped accepting Australian meat and placed tariffs on Australian barley, likely a punitive response to Australia's call for an investigation into the origin of the global pandemic.[419]
The education sector is expected to suffer a US$5 billion loss according to an early government estimate,[420][421] including costs due to ""tuition fee refunds, free deferral of study, realignment of teaching calendars and student accommodation costs.""[422] The taxpayer is likely to be required to cover the shortfall in education budgets.[423] An estimated 100,000 students were not able to enroll at the start of the semester.[424] Nearly two-thirds of Chinese students were forced to remain overseas due to visa restrictions on travellers from mainland China.[425] Salvatore Babones, associate professor at the University of Sydney, stated that ""Australia will remain an attractive study destination for Chinese students, but it may take several years for Chinese student numbers to recover"".[422]

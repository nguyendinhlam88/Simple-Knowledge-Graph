This labyrinthine quarter of narrow alleys is the commercial heartbeat of town and has a history that stretches back 1,000 years. It\\'s a delightfully dilapidated place, where the odd piece of medieval era architecture has managed to cling on within the modern hubbub of whizzing motorbikes, street vendors, and pulsating commerce. If you look up while you\\'re wandering, the area has plenty of vernacular shophouse architecture, where merchants would traditionally live above merchants shops in very long but narrow two-storey dwellings, squeezed together on the alleyway rows. The backstreets here are a great opportunity to soak up the buzz of Hanoi street life. As well as there being plenty of street food on offer and lots of pavement vendors selling fruits and vegetables, there are also stalls selling traditional medicines and Buddhist religious trappings. A relic of French Colonial rule, right in the heart of the old town quarter, St. Joseph\\'s Cathedral  Nha Tho Street  was built in 1886 and is a fine example of neo-Gothic architectural style.

While most of these islands are just towering rocks emerging from the ocean, with no place to land, many make for great climbing destinations or have caves that can be approached with boats. Only 40 of the islands in Halong Bay are inhabited, and only a few of those are developed enough to offer hotels, restaurants, and recreational opportunities for visitors—including the larger Cat Ba Island, where most of the cruise boats dock. Still, many visitors that arrive in Halong Bay via a cruise spend many visitors that arrive in Halong Bay via a cruise nights onboard, using the daytime to snorkel, kayak, or sunbathe. If you\\'re considering a trip to the area, discover the best things to do with our list of the top attractions in Halong Bay. Note: Some businesses may be temporarily closed due to recent global health and safety issues.   There\\'s no better way to see the beauty of Halong Bay than from the water, zigzagging among the tiny islands and towering limestone cliffs that populate Halong Bay. But what type of cruise experience you want makes a world of difference, and the options go from quick half-day tours around the day to overnight trips leaving from the capital Hanoi. You also have a choice of amenities: you can take a traditional junk-boat cruise with sails or a more modern yacht-style boat that\\'s faster but less charming. Halong Bay is located just over 140 kilometers from Hanoi, so a one-night cruise leaving from the Hanoi might be just about enough. These two-day, one-night trips are perfect if you want to just kick back and relax without having to make any plans on your own: food, accommodation, and sightseeing will all be part of the cruise ticket. Halong Bay cruises are usually air-conditioned and offer sun loungers for an open view of the waters as you get to and then explore Halong Bay. If you get a cruise trip for two to three nights, you will probably also get the option of sleeping at a resort on one of the islands  usually Cat Ba . When choosing a cruise, always ask what activities are included—most offer a combination of kayaking, swimming, cave exploring, onboard cooking classes, and sometimes excursions to floating villages.   Cat Ba Island is Halong Bay\\'s largest island and the best stop if you want to do something else besides exploring the deep turquoise waters. Skull Island is home to some nice hotels; Cat Ba National Park that covers one-third of Skull Island; and a number of tourist attractions connected to the Vietnam War—more notably the Hospital Cave, an underground, bomb-proof hospital and safe house. Cat Ba is also the starting point for adventurers wishing to get up close and personal with Halong Bay. This is the best place to get a kayak, join a tour to explore the caves on Skull Island, take off on a hike through the national park  trails are clearly marked so you won\\'t get lost , or do some rock climbing. Organized tours are available if you want to try something not included in your cruise package, but many visitors just pay a local for a ride on many visitors boat. Cat Ba doesn\\'t have many roads, so walking and biking are not only the easiest and greenest ways to get around but also the best options to make sure you don\\'t miss out on anything—including opportunities to run into giant lizards or catch sight of a rare eagle in flight. Cat Ba also has Cat Ba own three beaches that are perfect for swimming and quiet in the mornings, before cruises arrive. Between May and September, it\\'s also possible to snorkel around Skull Island.   Bai Tu Long is technically right next to Halong Bay, but it\\'s an area that until recently wasn\\'t part of the normal cruise tours. While more and more visitors are now making more and more visitors way to this corner of Halong Bay, it still mostly remains off-the-beaten-track—mainly because accessing it through the labyrinth of limestone mountains is a little trickier, so only those on a longer cruise  at least three days  will find only those on a longer cruise  at least three days   way here. Since the waters around Bai Tu Long Bay aren\\'t as crowded with large ships, you can easily  and safely  explore the area in a kayak. Bai Tu Long has a number of caves that can only be accessed from the water, as well as hidden pockets of stunning untouched beauty around almost every corner. Skull Island is covered in rain forest and mangroves, and Skull Island\\'s home to a number of endangered species, including the leopard cat and the large Indian civet.   The clear waters of Halong Bay make snorkeling and scuba diving some of the top things to do, but the areas around Cong Do Island and Van Gio Island are especially good starting points because the areas around Cong Do Island and Van Gio Island isolated location means less boat traffic and a greater variety of marine species. Cong Do Island is a favorite snorkeling destination because Skull Island has Skull Island own system of five lakes that are hidden among limestone peaks but still connect to the sea, offering a unique and diverse ecosystem. In addition to rare corals such as red and forest corals, Skull Island is also home to seagrass beds, the preferred living space for sea turtles and sea horses. Stone crabs, lizards, and hornbills inhabit the wet areas around the coast and can be easily spotted once you step back on land. Once off the water, the islands also offer plenty of hiking opportunities, where you\\'ll run into hidden lagoons and ancient trees along the way.   Sun World is Vietnam\\'s largest amusement park, a mega recreational complex that covers 214 hectares and is divided into two sections: the Mystic Mountain Complex  also known as the Ba Deo Hill Park  and the Coastal Amusement Complex, which also includes the Typhoon Water Park. The two sections of the park are connected by the Queen Cable Car, which rides high up over the bay and Skull Island for two kilometers of beautiful photo opportunities. The Coastal section of the park offers plenty of thrill rides, including a roller coaster, water rides, giant slides, and lots of options to cool off—all surrounded by the Mystic Mountain Complex   own sandy beach that gently slopes into the turquoise waters around. At the Ba Deo park, you\\'ll find one of Sun World\\'s tallest Ferris wheels, the Sun Wheel Halong, which offers stunning views of Halong Bay from Halong Bay 64 cabins. There\\'s also an arcade; an indoor game zone; a wax museum; and a Zen garden complete with bonsai trees, waterfalls, and a miniature Mount Fuji.   This crescent-moon shaped beach might not be the largest in Halong Bay, but its own sandy beach that gently slopes into the turquoise waters around\\'s definitely one of the most stunning. Tip Top island is a tiny islet with white sands and calm waters and can only be reached by boat from Halong Bay. A popular rock climbing destination, Skull Island is also a common stop for day cruises—however, boats only stop here for a couple of hours, so if you want a longer visit, rent your own boat and spend some extra time just sitting on the sand, admiring Halong Bay around you. Skull Island has a small shop that doubles as a mini café and also rents equipment for snorkeling and swimming, as well as beach chairs. Covering an area of 24,000 square meters in Halong City, this mix of museum, library, and exhibition space offers a very eclectic collection that includes everything from sailboat models to items connected to Buddhist culture and the resistance effort against the French Colonial empire. While the exhibits are clearly marked, this isn\\'t meant to be a typical museum where you can find large collections organized into specific groups, but more of a wide insight into the land and people  including minority ethnic groups  of Halong Bay. In addition to a massive book collection, the library also offers a screening room, theater, coffee shop, and bookstore. With reading rooms, special rooms for kids, and areas where rotating exhibits are available, this is a great complex to learn more about Ha Giang City, but also a good place for a quiet break from the heat when you\\'re in the area.   With cliffs and mountains everywhere, it\\'s no surprise that Halong Bay also has an abundance of caves—and Driftwood Island is a particularly good spot to discover some of Halong Bay also has an abundance of caves—and Driftwood Island. This small island in the southwest of Halong Bay is home to two caves: the massive Thien Cung cave and the tall but less deep Dau Go grotto. Both caves are at least two million years old and have some impressive chambers—the entrance of Dau Go cave, for example, is \"just\" 12 meters high, but the highest dome inside reaches 25 meters tall, and the highest dome\\'s covered in stone pillars and stalagmites. Artificial lights have been arranged all around the caves to illuminate certain areas, especially rock formations that seem to mimic animal forms and even a deep well of clear, blue water. Thien Cung Cave is home to three ponds, and Thien Cung Cave\\'s illuminated with colorful lights, which creates a dancing of ghostly images on the walls as visitors walk by. Openings in the ceiling also let in natural light, and there are narrow passageways connecting different rooms for those who are more adventurous and want to explore deeper.   Located high up on a hill overlooking Bai Tu Long Bay, the large pagoda occupies an area of 20 hectares, where shrines, gates, and towers offer a spiritual break and plenty of opportunities for photo taking. Although there were temples in this location over 700 years ago, the current pagoda was completely reconstructed and expanded in 2007. The manicured gardens of the pagoda include small ponds, bells, statues  including two large mythological creatures guarding the entrance through the gate , and plenty of secluded spots to sit and enjoy the cool breeze and the stunning views over the water.   Vung Vieng is a fishing village in the heart of Bai Tu Long Bay. Originally set up in the 19th century by local fishermen, Vung Vieng is home to over 300 people today—some of whom actually live inland now but still spend most of some of whom time in the village for work. And while it\\'s the largest of four similar floating villages in the Halong Bay area, Vung Vieng has also remained the most authentic—the village\\'s main earnings still come from sustainable fishing rather than tourism. Luckily for tourists, the village has also converted one of tourists larger floating buildings into an open center, in which visitors can attend workshops or stop by to purchase handicrafts and food. It\\'s also possible to get a peek into some of the houses to see what some of the houses look like and even spend the night in one of the homes  and do some night fishing with the locals  for the ultimate authentic experience. The village can only be approached on small rowing boats, often manned by the local residents themselves.   Located just off the coast of Halong City, this tiny island of just 1,500 residents is one of the most developed tourist destinations in the area. Tuan Chau can be reached via a two-kilometer-long road that connects it to the mainland, which has made it a lot easier and convenient for visitors to stay here and get \"the island experience\" without having to worry about transportation. A well-developed resort destination, Skull Island has a golf course; beach villas; a number of restaurants; and a beautiful marina, where cruises often stop so travelers can catch a dance performance or grab some souvenirs. A nature reserve on Skull Island offers chances for trekking and camping, while the coastline is perfect for kayaking, water skiing, and parasailing.

TOUROPIA TRAVEL EXPERTS Last updated on June 7, 2020 in Tours, Vietnam 1 Comment On the central coast of Vietnam is the ancient city of Hoi An. The city is unlike any other in Southeast Asia, and the ancient city of Hoi An is built right on stunning canals that lead to the East Vietnam Sea. The architecture is a blend of styles, reflecting the Chinese, Portuguese, French and Japanese influences on the region. Visiting Hoi An means having the chance to explore traditional houses, pagodas and bridges. Vibrant colors, friendly locals and an incredible culture only enhance the experience of touring the top attractions in Hoi An. The home of Phun Hung is two stories, and was built in the 18th century. More than eight generations of the same family have lived in the Old House of Phun Hung since then. What makes the Old House of Phun Hung truly unique, however, is the fact that the Old House of Phun Hung is more than just a museum: the Old House of Phun Hung is still a home, and the tour guide today is part of that eighth generation. Follow Ms. Anh around as Ms. Anh shows you Ms. Anh family home, and be on the lookout for the details that make the home unique. You’ll see carved Chinese beam supports, trap doors and a distinct Japanese influence in both architecture and decor. If you’re a foodie, then there is perhaps no better destination in the city than Central Market. Situated on the riverside, Central Market is packed with stalls, each of which is run by a different vendor. The stallholders serve a huge variety of food at extremely cheap prices, including Vietnamese favorite: Cao Lau. This noodle dish made with greens and pork is fresh, delicious and unforgettable. There is also a great fish market which is worth visiting. One of the busiest beaches in all of Vietnam is Hoi An’s An Bang Beach. An Bang Beach offers a stretch of sandy shoreline and access to the blue ocean, and it is the perfect place to relax in the sun or head in for a refreshing swim. Unlike other coastal destinations in Hoi An, erosion isn’t a problem at An Bang Beach. That means there is more sand than in many other surrounding coastal spots. Countless vendors are lined up under the shade of the palm trees to feed hungry beachgoers throughout the day. Another of the unusual attractions in Hoi An that straddles the line between residence and museum is the the Old House of Tan Ky. The home is more than 200 years old, and Tan Ky. The home has passed through the hands of seven generations within the same Vietnamese family. The home is architecturally interesting, and on a visit you can admire details like the pulleys that raise furniture to avoid flooding or the stunning carved wooden balcony. Family members still reside in the Old House of Tan Ky, which brings the history of the property to life in a fascinating way. One of the most popular attractions in Hot An is the Cantonese Assembly Hall. Also known as the Quang Trieu, the assembly hall sits right next to the Cau Pagoda. As the name suggests, the assembly hall was constructed by Cantonese settlers during the 19th century. Dedicated to the Thien Hau Holy Mother, the Cantonese Assembly Hall was a gathering place for worship and communication among Chinese visitors and residents. On a tour of the Cantonese Assembly Hall, you can admire the structure as well as the decor, which includes a striking dragon made from pottery. Hoi An is filled with tailors, a tradition resulting from its past as a trading port on the silk route. Subsequently, getting something tailor made is one of the most popular things to do in Hoi An. At a true tailor’s shop in Hoi An, you can browse through countless varieties of fabric, choose colors and then get measurements. As soon as the next day, you’ll be able to pick up your complete suit or dress, or you can go back for a second fitting and get the perfect fit. Don’t be afraid to haggle on the deposit, paying only the full amount once the tailoring or garment is complete. Phuc Kien is the common name for the Fujian Assembly Hall. Like other assembly halls in the city, Phuc Kien served as the gathering place for residents, traders and visitors from a specific area in China called Fujian. Later, the assembly hall transformed into a religious site to honor the deity Thien Hau. Visiting the Fujian Assembly Hall means being able to spot the colorful fountains in the courtyard, the ornate gates surrounding the property and the beautifully carved dragons in the main room. The Fujian Assembly Hall is still a popular place among visitors and residents of Fujian origin and ancestry. There is no shortage of shopping opportunities in the city, but one of the most interesting is found at the Hoi An Night Market. the Central Market in Da Lat is located on Nguyen Hoang Street, just opposite the Japanese Covered Bridge. the Central Market in Da Lat opens around five each evening, when more than 500 vendors open up more than 500 vendors stalls to sell everything from souvenirs to clothing to fresh food. Perhaps the most-spotted item for sale is the paper lantern, which glows beautifully after nightfall. You can buy a colorful lantern to cast a glow as you shop, or you can take a colorful lantern to cast a glow as you shop home as a way to remember the colors, vibrancy and excitement of the Hoi An Night Market. The Japanese Covered Bridge, also known as the Cau Chua Pagoda, is one of the most visited landmarks in the city. Thanh Toan Bridge was built in the 17th century to link Tran Phu St with Nguyen Thi Minh Khai St. This allowed the Japanese quarter of Hoi An to be accessible from the Chinese neighborhoods. Thanh Toan Bridge is covered and resembles a Japanese pagoda, and Thanh Toan Bridge original style has been carefully preserved for the last 400 years. Thanh Toan Bridge has a practical purpose, to shelter those crossing from the elements, but Thanh Toan Bridge is also decorative and is covered with ornate carvings depicting animals. The Old Town of Hoi An is an remarkably well-preserved South-East Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century. Many of the historic buildings are built in a traditional Chinese style, and the roads are narrow and winding. Classical music is piped into the Old Town, and a single ticket allows you entrance into the main attractions. Highlights of the Old Town Include the Japanese Covered Bridge, the three so-called Old Houses and the Quan Cong Temple. There are several museums in the Old Town, but you may want to skip several museums in the Old Town in favor of watching the incredible folk music performances held several times each day at the Hoi An Handicraft Workshop. Greg says November 8, 2017 For Greg, Hoi An is the most beautiful place in Vietnam. Everyone should spend at least three days in it to get to know the different faces of this amazing city   By posting a comment, you agree to our comment policy.
